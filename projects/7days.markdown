A fast prototyping framework made in C++ and [SFML][]. I didn't develop it as much as it's a collection of stuff I've found useful when making games.

A list of games I've made with it:

* [Sat-E][] *Ludum Dare 22*
* [My Minions][] *Ludum Dare 20*
* [Where's Teddy?][] *Game Design course*
* [Beebop The Island Hopper][] *Ludum Dare 17*
* [A Geek Valentine][] *Experimental Gameplay Project*
* [The Chronicles of Bim: The 100 Fake Afros][] *Experimental Gameplay Project*
* [Jonas IceCream Stand][] *Experimental Gameplay Project*
* [MenuCity][] *Experimental Gameplay Project*
* [Bugger][] *Experimental Gameplay Project*
* [Black and White][] *Experimental Gameplay Project*
* [Balls][] *Experimental Gameplay Project*
