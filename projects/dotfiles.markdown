Some are incomplete and unused, but others such as [.vimrc][] are more complete. I also have my [xmonad][] dual screen setup and some scripts for the desktop there.

[.vimrc]: http://github.com/treeman/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc ".vimrc I use"
[xmonad]: http://xmonad.org/ "xmonad a nice tiling window manager"
