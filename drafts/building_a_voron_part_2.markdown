# Tap

Hardware Kit + OptoTap rev2.4.1 5v or 24v OPB666N HIGH TEMP + D2HW

No mention of items from the changelog in the manual:
https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Tap/blob/main/images/RC8/RC8_changelog.png

Not sure what version of Tap I have.
The hardware kit seems up to date (it has 4 magnets, large screws etc), but I don't know about the printed parts as they didn't match the manual.
Either the manual isn't updated (I know it's missing some pieces), but it could also be the parts that are from an older revision.
I don't know.

# Clockwork mod

>  THIS MOD NO LONGER REQUIRED for V2.4 Rev. C - the kit includes the Stealthburner PCBs and works with the stock parts.

I'm not usiang a V2.4, so I didn't think it applied to me.
Which was wrong, as I'm building a Trident Rev. C, so this was completely unnecessary.

So I redid everything.

# Installing a hotend

Rapido installation instructions at www.phaetus.com/rapido-hotend led to nowhere.
Couldn't find any VORON documentation on how to install it.

Found a YouTube video showing how to install it:

# PCB
