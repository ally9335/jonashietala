This is my [yearly review][] #14.
Amazing that I've kept up with this for 14 years.

# 2023 Non-Geek Achievements

- Wrote [16 blog posts][posts]!

  Most of them were written (and published) in the last quarter where I got bitten by the blogging bug.

- I wrapped up my series about the [T-34 keyboard layout][t-34].

# 2023 Geek Achievements

- [I beat FTL on Hard with all ships in the game][ftl].
- [I built a VORON][VORON] and got into 3D printing.
- [Two][hn1] of [my][hn2] blog posts got to the front page of Hacker News.

  I've always blogged to write for myself and never because I wanted my blog to be popular, but it was still nice to see some people appreciate it.

- I [rewrote my Neovim config in Lua][neovim-lua].
- I gave the blog a [sorely needed facelift][facelift].

# 2023 Misadventures

- While I finished the eBook of [my book][], I only made it available for purchase using cryptocurrencies a short amount of time.

  The reason is that I made it available with [my payment processor][bitpal], but I ran out of energy so I shut down the server.
  I really need to get it together and just upload it somewhere so it's purchasable normally.

- I didn't read that many books---at least I don't remember that I did.

- Despite me trying to reduce it, the boardgame list of shame grew this year.

  There's a complete stop to Kickstarters and buying new games until I correct this mess.

# Plans for 2024

- Finally complete the book project by putting the eBook widely available and finishing the [How I wrote 'Why Cryptocurrencies?'][crypto-series] series.

- Focus on mental and physical health, with a focus on strength training.
