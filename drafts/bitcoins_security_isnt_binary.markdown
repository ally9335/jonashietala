I'd like to address a misconception that's at the core in many Bitcoin discussions lately: Bitcoin's security isn't binary. In fact security in general isn't black and white. It's a trade-off being secure enough for your threat model vs the cost and feasibility of your protection.

Consider having your front door locked for example. You could consider your home secure if your door is locked and insecure if it's open but that doesn't say what you're secure against. It might prevent opportunistic thefts but a more determined attacker could instead break a window, pick the lock of the door or simply break down the door itself. Maybe you live in a neighborhood with lots of thefts and you might want an alarm system, iron bars over your windows or a dog.

At the same time it might not be practical to go all out and get the best protection possible. You might not want to give up your life and move to a bunker where your friends can't visit and a private security force may be slightly too expensive.

In practice locking your door is good enough for many people. Some people do more and there are many options for them including private security for celebrities. That's okay since threat models and feeling of security is different for everyone. This is the case for Bitcoin as well. Some sell houses for Bitcoin and have high security requirements while others sell coffee and have less. Unfortunately people, including developers, don't acknowledge that Bitcoin is more fine grained than "secure" and "insecure".

run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.

> Running a full node makes you an actual Bitcoin user

[Here's Luke-Jr's response](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/52148/should-i-use-a-full-node-as-my-main-wallet) to the question "Should I use a full node as my main wallet?" on the bitcoin stackexchange:

> If you're not using a full node for your wallet, you're not using Bitcoin, and won't get the benefits Bitcoin provides over fiat currency. You might as well be using PayPal in that case, except with a random anonymous person in place of a regulated company...
>
> So, always use a full node.
