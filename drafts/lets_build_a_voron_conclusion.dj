It's finally doneâ„¢.
I've built a VORON that prints reliably and I've modded it enough to be able to leave it alone for a while, so I think it's time to wrap up this build series with a little retrospective.

TODO video of print in progress here

# The build

# Printing

## No major issues

- Apart from initial temperature calibration, only some issues with first layers

## So many things to learn

- Klipper configuration
- Slicer management
- Nozzle sizes, filament selection, supports, brims...
- Stuck filament, wet filament, filament tuning...

# Future plans

One might think that the printer is complete and that I won't touch it anymore, but no.
Oh no, I've a bunch of large mods I want to do with the printer:

i. Replace the camera I have with a better one.
i. Remove drag chains and go umbilical.
i. Complete the [purge bucket mod][].
i. Replace Stealthburner with the [Xol toolhead][] for better PLA cooling.
i. Multimaterial with the [Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder][].

But before that I've identified a fatal flaw:
I only have a single printer.

What should I do if I find that I'm missing a printed part when I've disassembled the printer to mod it?
What if I break something?
And if I'm doing a long mod the printer will be down and I can't print things for any other project.

This clearly isn't a sustainable solution---I need a second printer.

And isn't that the best compliment one can give?
That you haven't even finished it yet, but you're already pining for _another one_?

- Even though I've tried to be as detailed as possible, there are still many things I left out:
  - G-code configuration
  - Slicer management
  - Minor issues here and there (stuck filament, wet filament, etc)
- Thought about VORON?
- Thought about the LDO kit?
- Thought about Tap?
- No idea how many hours I've put into it

The printer has X hours already.

# Issues

1. Noisy
1. Not the best for PLA
1. Had to mod in HEPA filter, and still not sure I want to work next to it
