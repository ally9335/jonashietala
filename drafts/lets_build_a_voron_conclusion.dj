It's finally doneâ„¢.
I've built a VORON that prints reliably and I've modded it enough to be able to leave it alone for a while, so I think it's time to wrap up this build series with a little retrospective.

TODO video of print in progress here

# The build

## What about LDO?

# Printing

## No major issues

- Apart from initial temperature calibration, zero issues with first layers

## So many things to learn

- Klipper configuration
- Slicer management
- Nozzle sizes, filament selection, supports, brims...
- Stuck filament, wet filament, filament tuning...


---

- Even though I've tried to be as detailed as possible, there are still many things I left out:
  - G-code configuration
  - Slicer management
  - Minor issues here and there (stuck filament, wet filament, etc)
- Thought about VORON?
- Thought about the LDO kit?
- Thought about Tap?
- No idea how many hours I've put into it

The printer has X hours already.

# Issues

1. Noisy
1. Not the best for PLA
1. Had to mod in HEPA filter, and still not sure I want to work next to it

# What's left?

1. A backup printer
2. Multimaterial support
3. Other toolheads
