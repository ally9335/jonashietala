(Background)


# Is it burnout, depression or both?

I find it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what I've been through.
The first doctor I met diagnosed me as suffering from "extreme stress", without mentioning depression.
The psychologist I met next didn't think I had any signs of depression either, but the one after that (that I worked with for a few months with KBT) thought I showed clear signs of depression as well as being burnt-out.

> I'm not sure "burnout" is the right medical term for it, but it's the most common description I've heard so I'll stick with it.
{ :notice }

I'm told that burnout can often lead to depression (or vice-versa) and I think that's what happened to me.
I think I had some of the depression-related signs, such as not finding enjoyment in my hobbies anymore or not having a positive outlook for the future.

That I've been through burnout is pretty clear, and luckily I noticed what happened in time before it got really bad.
I could still get out of bed and function as a father and a co-worker, but it was all rapidly going downhill.


# No apparent reason 

I've had large difficulties to accept the burnout because if I try to distance myself from the problem and look at it objectively from a distance, it doesn't make sense that I would become a victim.
I have all these great benefits that I've been trying to obtain:

- A great family, with two amazing boys that I love with all my heart.

  Apart from having 3-4 too early mornings a week, there's nothing to complain about.

- Low stress from work.

  It seems if you read about burnout online, everything seems to circle around too much stress from work. Either too long hours, too many responsibilities, bad bosses, bad co-workers, too tight deadlines or a combination of it all is always the culprit.

  But I just can't relate to any of that.

- Few and flexible working hours.

  Apart from having flexible working hours, so as long as I'm there for some meetings I can basically decide when I should work. It's super nice to be able to take an extra hour of sleep if I woke up too early with the kids, or take an hour to do some weight lifting.

  I also don't work too many hours. I've been working 80% (32h / week) since more than a year back, and I'm good at never exceeding that.

- I work remotely.

  Barring a handful of yearly trips, which I *want* to do because of social reasons, I've been working remotely since 4 years now.
  And there are some massive benefits to it, like being able to work without disturbance from my home office and being able to take a break whenever I want to without getting stared at.

- I'm able to work professionally in Rust.

  Rust is a favorite language of many programmers, but finding a non-crypto Rust job is very difficult.
  Yet, I somehow managed to land a Rust job (well, my employer started some projects in Rust and I started working on those).

- Good salary.

  While I could absolutely push my salary higher if I was motivated enough to switch jobs or start my own consulting business, I earn enough for my current needs.


It feels like the other stories about burnout always have this obvious reason for people hitting the wall (like working 80+ hours a week), but I just can't find an easy explanation for me.

Maybe it's just too difficult to realize it yourself when it's all happening, and maybe I'm still in it?


# Red flags

While it was difficult for me to see the cause, I did notice some of the big red flags signalling that I was getting (or that I already were) burnt-out.

I'm not saying it's easy to see the warning signals---it's not---but I have the advantage of having gone through a larger burnout/depression episode around 8 years ago. The big warning signal was the same this time as it was back then, 


Still, the big 

- Fun things stopped being fun

- Lack of energy
- Cynical
    About my work, about my projects and abut the future in general
- More irritation
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Side projects stopped
- Work performance dropped




# The downward spiral

No energy -> I don't accomplish things -> Unhappy because I don't do things -> No energy because I'm unhappy


# Struggling to find a balance

To battle burnout: take it easy  
To battle depression: do things


# A lack of enjoyment or meaning


# What helped me

The only thing that *really* helped:

1. Sick leave
2. Followed by a long 7 weeks vacation

These are auxiliary things that helped the process along:

3. Lot's of walking
4. Physical exercise
5. Do things that I used to enjoy
6. Rest
7. Program (but in very small doses)
