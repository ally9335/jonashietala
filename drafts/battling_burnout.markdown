(Background)


# Is it burnout, depression or both?

I find it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what I've been through.
The first doctor I met diagnosed me as suffering from "extreme stress", without mentioning depression.
The psychologist I met next didn't think I had any signs of depression either, but the one after that (that I worked with for a few months with KBT) thought I showed clear signs of depression as well as being burnt-out.

## Signs of burnout

Doing a little research of my own, I clearly displayed the three clusters of burnout:

1. Emotional and physical exhaustion
2. Cynicism
3. Lower productivity

This to an extent that it effected my work- and personal life, but not so much that I couldn't get out of bed.

## Signs of depression

I don't recognize all the symptoms of depression, but I did display some of them:

1. Negative outlook of the future
1. Depressed mood
1. Diminished pleasure
1. Easily agitated
1. Gained weight

These weren't *that* serious, and I never had the really serious signs like suicidal thoughts, but it did feel like the symptoms were getting worse and I'm sure if I didn't do anything about the underlying causes then it would eventually spiral out of control.

Still, I consider burnout to be the primary issue, with the depression following along like an added bonus.

# No apparent reason

I've had large difficulties to accept the burnout because if I try to distance myself from the problem and look at it objectively from a distance, it doesn't make sense that I would become a victim.
I have all these great benefits that I've worked at a long time trying to obtain:

- A great family, with two amazing boys that I love with all my heart.

  Apart from having 3-4 too early mornings a week, there's nothing to complain about.

- Low stress from work.

  It seems if you read about burnout online, everything seems to circle around too much stress from work. Either too long hours, too many responsibilities, bad bosses, bad co-workers, too tight deadlines or a combination of it all is always the culprit.

  But I just can't relate to any of that.

- Few and flexible working hours.

  Apart from having flexible working hours, so as long as I'm there for some meetings I can basically decide when I should work.
  It's super nice to be able to take an extra hour of sleep if I woke up too early with the kids, or take an hour to do some weight lifting.

  I also don't work too many hours. I've been working 80% (32h / week) since more than a year back, and I'm good at not exceeding that.

- I work remotely.

  Barring a handful of yearly trips, which I've been wanting to do because of social reasons, I've been working remotely since 4 years now.
  And there are some massive benefits to it, like being able to work without disturbance from my home office and 

- I'm able to work professionally in Rust.

  Rust is a favorite language of many programmers, but finding a non-crypto Rust job is very difficult.
  But here I am with a Rust job.
  (My employer started some projects in Rust and I started working on those.)

- Good salary.

  While I could absolutely push my salary higher if I was motivated enough to switch jobs or start my own consulting business, I earn more than enough for my current needs.


It feels like the other stories about burnout always have this obvious reason for people hitting the wall (like working 80+ hours a week), but I just can't find an easy explanation for me.

Maybe it's just too difficult to realize it yourself when it's all happening?
I thought I was getting over it, but maybe I'm still in it?


# Red flags

While it was (and is) difficult for me to see the cause, I did notice some of the big red flags signalling that I was getting, or already was, burnt-out:

- **Things weren't fun**

  Even my favorite hobbies lost their appeal.

- **I became more cynical**

  > It's not worth doing this...

  > It makes no difference...

  > This won't help anyone...

- **Lack of energy**

  I still wanted to do lots of things, but I just didn't have the energy to do them.

- **Difficulty falling asleep**

  Even though I was constantly tired, it got harder and harder to fall asleep.

- **More easily irritated**

  Getting annoyed and even angry at trivial things.

- **I didn't make any progress on my side projects**

  Mind you, programming in some way or another has been my main hobby for over a decade.

- **Work performance dropped**

  I didn't get any comments from co-workers, but I felt that I wasn't nearly as productive as I was 3-6 months previously, let alone a year or two ago.

When I list them like this it might seem like it should be easy to notice them, but it's really not.
They creep up on you and it's hard to see them when you're in the middle of it yourself.
(It's easier to see faults in others after all.)

The first time I thought that maybe I'm becoming burnt-out is when I was watching some fantastic TV-series ([Better Call Saul][] and [Money Heist][]).
They were so good that I often thought about them---even dreamt of them---and I couldn't wait to see the next episode.
Yet after the amazing Better Call Saul episode with Nacho (season 6 episode 3, you know which one if you've seen the show) I just couldn't make myself to see the next episode.

It's a weird feeling when you *know* you love something, but you feel completely drained of joy when you think about doing it, but I can't describe it any other way.

This can be difficult to recognize, but I did have the advantage of having gone through a burnout/depression episode around 8 years ago, when I had the same feeling of joylessness.

> I've finished Better Call Saul now and the rest of the season was as good as I remembered. I still have two seasons of Money Heist left.

# Struggling to find a balance

After having this realization, I did what everyone always recommends you to do, which is to seek out professional help.
And I'm glad I did, because without it I probably would've crashed *much* harder.

I'll go into [more detail](#what-helped-me) on what specifically helped me, but I think it's important to recognize that in the end you're the only one who can solve your problems.

And for me my biggest problem was how to find a balance in how I addressed my burnout, and how I addressed my depression.

To simplify, this is the big picture approach:

- **To battle burnout**

  Take it easy to regain energy.

- **To battle depression**

  Do things to make me feel accomplished and increase my happiness.

The problem here is that they often interfere with each other. If I take it easy and do nothing, I feel terrible because I didn't accomplish anything and I feel like a complete failure, and if I force myself to do lots of things I feel absolutely exhausted afterwards.

A good example is how I very much wanted to get back to programming on my free time on my own projects.
It's one my favorite things to do, and I knew that if I could get back to it I would get some enjoyment back into my life and some satisfaction on having done *something*.

So one day I decided to work on something new, without any deadlines or anything to stress me out.
Just do it for fun you know?

I decided to [rewrite my blog in Rust][rewrite] and I tried to just get started.
And started I did, and the hours went.
And went.
Until I most of the day had passed and I had missed my lunch and all the breaks I should've taken.
And I crashed for a few days, my energy was completely spent.

It was a success in that it was fun, and I accomplished something, but I completely failed in regaining energy.

This is an extreme example just illustrate the issue---most of the time it was not nearly as severe---but finding a balance was something I constantly struggled with.

This is perhaps an extreme example. Most of time it wasn't as severe, but 

This is perhaps an extreme example, and you might find it hard to relate to this problem, but finding a good balance is something I personally struggled with a lot (and I still do).

# What's the root problem?


# What helped me

The only thing that *really* helped:

1. Sick leave
2. Followed by a long 7 weeks vacation

These are auxiliary things that helped the process along:

3. Lot's of walking
4. Physical exercise
5. Do things that I used to enjoy
6. Rest
7. Program (but in very small doses)
