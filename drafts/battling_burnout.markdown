(Background)


# Is it burnout, depression or both?

I find it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what I've been through.
The first doctor I met diagnosed me as suffering from "extreme stress", without mentioning depression.
The psychologist I met next didn't think I had any signs of depression either, but the one after that (that I worked with for a few months with KBT) thought I showed clear signs of depression as well as being burnt-out.

## Signs of burnout

Doing a little research of my own, I clearly displayed the three clusters of burnout:

1. Emotional and physical exhaustion
2. Cynicism
3. Lower productivity

This to an extent that it effected my work- and personal life, but not so much that I couldn't get out of bed.

## Signs of depression

I don't recognize all the symptoms of depression, but I did display some of them:

1. Negative outlook of the future
1. Depressed mood
1. Diminished pleasure
1. Easily agitated
1. Gained weight

These weren't *that* serious, and I never had the really serious signs like suicidal thoughts, but it did feel like the symptoms were getting worse and I'm sure if I didn't do anything about the underlying causes then it would eventually spiral out of control.

Still, I consider burnout to be the primary issue, with the depression following along like an added bonus.

# No apparent reason

I've had large difficulties to accept the burnout because if I try to distance myself from the problem and look at it objectively from a distance, it doesn't make sense that I would become a victim.
I have all these great benefits that I've worked at a long time trying to obtain:

- A great family, with two amazing boys that I love with all my heart.

  Apart from having 3-4 too early mornings a week, there's nothing to complain about.

- Low stress from work.

  It seems if you read about burnout online, everything seems to circle around too much stress from work. Either too long hours, too many responsibilities, bad bosses, bad co-workers, too tight deadlines or a combination of it all is always the culprit.

  But I just can't relate to any of that.

- Few and flexible working hours.

  Apart from having flexible working hours, so as long as I'm there for some meetings I can basically decide when I should work.
  It's super nice to be able to take an extra hour of sleep if I woke up too early with the kids, or take an hour to do some weight lifting.

  I also don't work too many hours. I've been working 80% (32h / week) since more than a year back, and I'm good at not exceeding that.

- I work remotely.

  Barring a handful of yearly trips, which I've been wanting to do because of social reasons, I've been working remotely since 4 years now.
  And there are some massive benefits to it, like being able to work without disturbance from my home office and 

- I'm able to work professionally in Rust.

  Rust is a favorite language of many programmers, but finding a non-crypto Rust job is very difficult.
  But here I am with a Rust job.
  (My employer started some projects in Rust and I started working on those.)

- Good salary.

  While I could absolutely push my salary higher if I was motivated enough to switch jobs or start my own consulting business, I earn more than enough for my current needs.


It feels like the other stories about burnout always have this obvious reason for people hitting the wall (like working 80+ hours a week), but I just can't find an easy explanation for me.

Maybe it's just too difficult to realize it yourself when it's all happening?
I thought I was getting over it, but maybe I'm still in it?


# Red flags

While it was (and is) difficult for me to see the cause, I did notice some of the big red flags signalling that I was getting, or already was, burnt-out:

- **Things weren't fun**

  Even my favorite hobbies lost their appeal.

- **I became more cynical**

  > It's not worth doing this...

  > It makes no difference...

  > This won't help anyone...

- **Lack of energy**

  I still wanted to do lots of things, but I just didn't have the energy to do them.

- **Difficulty falling asleep**

  Even though I was constantly tired, it got harder and harder to fall asleep.

- **More easily irritated**

  Getting annoyed and even angry at trivial things.

- **I didn't make any progress on my side projects**

  Mind you, programming in some way or another has been my main hobby for over a decade.

- **Work performance dropped**

  I didn't get any comments from co-workers, but I felt that I wasn't nearly as productive as I was 3-6 months previously, let alone a year or two ago.

When I list them like this it might seem like it should be easy to notice them, but it's really not.
They creep up on you and it's hard to see them when you're in the middle of it yourself.
(It's easier to see faults in others after all.)

The first time I thought that maybe I'm becoming burnt-out is when I was watching some fantastic TV-series ([Better Call Saul][] and [Money Heist][]).
They were so good that I often thought about them---even dreamt of them---and I couldn't wait to see the next episode.
Yet after the amazing Better Call Saul episode with Nacho (season 6 episode 3, you know which one if you've seen the show) I just couldn't make myself to see the next episode.

It's a weird feeling when you *know* you love something, but you feel completely drained of joy when you think about doing it, but I can't describe it any other way.

This can be difficult to recognize, but I did have the advantage of having gone through a burnout/depression episode around 8 years ago, when I had the same feeling of joylessness.

> I've finished Better Call Saul now and the rest of the season was as good as I remembered. I still have two seasons of Money Heist left.

# Seeking help

But even if I noticed some of the red flags, and I did try to make some small changes, the real wake-up call was when I was flying home from a work trip and I got this extreme headache.
It was more extreme than I had ever had (and I've had occasional migraine attacks for years), so much that I thought I was getting a stroke or something.
While the pain dissipated in a few minutes, I felt sick the whole day after.

I didn't have a stroke, it was declared as "only" a migraine attack, but it was clear I had to take it seriously.
So I did what everyone recommends: I sought professional help.

And I'm glad I did, because without it I probably would've crashed *much* harder.

The company I work for took it seriously and was incredibly helpful and were very supportive throughout the whole process.
They reduced my workload as much as possible, made it clear that that I could take as much time off as needed and importantly they never made me feel guilty.

Admitting that I had a problem was a difficult thing.
I really wanted to hide that I went on sick leave from my partner---a very clear vote for fleeing over fighting.
Maybe if I didn't tell anyone I could continue fooling myself that everything was fine?


# Struggling to find a balance
And I'm glad I did, because without it I probably would've crashed *much* harder.

I'll go into [more detail](#what-helped-me) on what specifically helped me, but I think it's important to recognize that in the end you're the only one who can solve your problems.

And for me my biggest problem was how to find a balance in how I addressed my burnout, and how I addressed my depression.

To simplify, this is the big picture approach:

- **To battle burnout**

  Take it easy to regain energy.

- **To battle depression**

  Do things to make me feel accomplished and increase my happiness.

The problem here is that they often interfere with each other. If I take it easy and do nothing, I feel terrible because I didn't accomplish anything and I feel like a complete failure, and if I force myself to do lots of things I feel absolutely exhausted afterwards.

A good example is how I very much wanted to get back to programming on my free time on my own projects.
It's one my favorite things to do, and I knew that if I could get back to it I would get some enjoyment back into my life and some satisfaction on having done *something*.

So one day I decided to work on something new, without any deadlines or anything to stress me out.
Just do it for fun you know?

I decided to [rewrite my blog in Rust][rewrite] and I tried to just get started.
And started I did, and the hours went.
And went.
Until I most of the day had passed and I had missed my lunch and all the breaks I should've taken.
And I crashed for a few days, my energy was completely spent.

It was a success in that it was fun, and I accomplished something, but I completely failed in regaining energy.

This is an extreme example just illustrate the issue---most of the time it was not nearly as severe---but finding a balance was something I constantly struggled with.

# What's the actual cause?

While the root cause wasn't external stress, such as work pressure, for me it was *internal* stress coming from me pressuring myself.

One big part of it is all my different projects I've got going.
Having projects to work on has always been a source of enjoyment and even pride.
It's not that I seek fame or recognition, it's the simple and wonderful feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction of a project well done that drives me.

Unfortunately, I have too many large and unfinished projects that started to stress me out because they weren't finished, and as my productivity slowed down they stressed me out even more.

Here are of some of my ongoing software development projects:

- Finish my book: [Why Cryptocurrencies?][]

  I *only* need to restyle the e-book and allow people to buy it from my site.
  The physical book has been done over a year ago.
  Then maybe do some marketing for it (although that thought alone makes my stress levels rise).

- Release the first version of [BitPal][]

  I wanted to allow people to buy my book about crypto with crypto, so I started working on my own self-hosted solution.

  It's *so close* to being "done", I've already done 90% so it's only the last 90% left now.

- Finish my git implementation in Rust

  I've worked through one-third of [Building Git][] (but with Rust instead of Ruby), and I would really like to continue with the fun branching and rebasing stuff.

  (This is just a toy project to learn Git a little better.)

- Rewrite the site for our grappling club

  I'd like to have member account, track billing and have some notification system for when training sessions are canceled.
  Simple stuff.
  If we ignore the idea of tracking attendance and topics of each session, so we can plan an adaptive spaced repetition curriculum to optimize learning.

  And yet, I'm stuck on getting the styling and layout on the page right.


While creating things is important to me, something else that's even more important to me---and arguably is part of my personal identity---is for me to improve my skills.
It's not about reaching some goal, but I relish the feeling of learning something new or being able to do something I previously could not.

Here's a few things that I'm working on:

- Programming skills

  Learning new languages, tools and new ways of solving problems in a faster or simpler way.

- Strength training

  I used to think that squatting is easy.
  But the more I learn about it, the harder it seems.

- Grappling

  I don't train that much (1-2 times a week), but still the learning and research continues with tons of hours of instructionals available.

- Memory training

  The main goal was to supercharge language learning by making it easier to learn lots of new words.
  Honestly though, it was years since I last worked on it.

It shouldn't be like this, but I feel sad or bad when I'm not trying to improve at something.


And what stresses me out even more are the things I **should** be doing, but haven't started yet. For instance:

- [Make a roguelike][make-roguelike] in Rust
- Create a board game
- Learn Korean, Japanese, Finnish...
- Listen to hundreds of hours in my podcast app (not including audiobooks, I use Audible for those)
- Finish dozens of programming books on my to-read list
- Finish dozens of fiction books on my to-read list
- etc ...

Each of these items I list aren't that stressful by themselves, it's the combination of many small stressors that over time has caused me an awful amount of stress.

# What helped me

The only thing that *really* helped:

1. Sick leave
2. Followed by a long 7 weeks vacation

These are auxiliary things that helped the process along:

1. Be kind towards myself
3. Lot's of walking
4. Physical exercise
5. Do things that I used to enjoy
6. Rest
7. Program (but in very small doses)
