Exercise and Health
===================

The goal is to get fit.

1. Eat more strict LCHF for 1 month

    I can achieve this because I've done it before. To achieve it I will not overeat on lunch and choose a better alternative. For snacks I will choose carrots, eggs and water with some dark chocolate or wine. Then we will plan better dinner.

    This will be achieved by: aug 28  
    The reward will be: 

1. 1 month of MMA and/or BJJ

    2 days a week after work. I can achieve it because I like challenges and it fills a hole in my martial arts knowledge.

    This will be achieved by: oct 2  
    The reward will be: 

1. 2 months of energetic power lifting at the gym

    I will go to the gym 3 times a week during lunch and buy salad next door for lunch and I will train for ~45 min. I can achieve it because I've done it before and I felt good about it. I will go to either kampsportcentret's gym or to place near work.

    This will be achieved by: oct 30  
    The reward will be: 

1. 100 kg deadlift 5x5, 75 kg bench 5x5, 85 kg squat 5x5

    I have reached comparable results before and with dedicated training I should be able to go beyond previous results. A couple of months with lunch gym training should be enough. To combat the grip issue I will bring a grip trainer to work.

    This will be achieved by: nov 27  
    The reward will be: 

1. Side split with both feet besides the yoga mat

    I have knowledge about the theory and I will implement a good routine. By forcing light stretching several times a week and one hard training each week improvements should be constant.

    This will be achieved by: dec 25  
    The reward will be: 

Benefits
--------

The main benefits:

1. Happier about myself.
1. More energy in my life.
1. Remove the dissatisfaction I've had the last years about not having exercised enough.
1. Feel better when I'm better at martial arts.


Build a custom keyboard
=======================

The goal is to build a custom keyboard and to get started with hacking electronics.

1. Build a 3x3 LED cube.

    I've got the knowledge and soon the tools. An hour here or there should do it.

    This will be achieved by: dec 25  
    The reward will be: 

1. Construct the keyboard.

    A bigger project which shouldn't be out of my league.

    This will be achieved by: dec 25  
    The reward will be: 

1. Use our own keyboard

    After the keyboard is made connection/programming should be the simple part, it's just a case of determination and after I've started the project I shouldn't be able to simply drop it. I will set aside an hour here and there for simple poking.

    This will be achieved by: dec 25  
    The reward will be: 

Benefits
--------

1. Expanded knowledge gives great satisfaction.
1. A long overdue project. The satisfaction of completing the project should be very big.
