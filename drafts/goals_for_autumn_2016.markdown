x

1. Gym 3x a week
1. Martial arts (BJJ/MMA) 2x a week
1. Isometric stretch 1x a week


Exercise and Health
===================

The goal is to get fit.

1. Eat more strict LCHF for 1 month

    I can achieve this because I've done it before. To achieve it I will not overeat on lunch and choose a better alternative. For snacks I will choose carrots, eggs and water with some dark chocolate or wine. Then we will plan better dinner.

    This will be achieved by: Aug 28  
    The reward will be: Massage

1. Start BJJ

    2 days a week after work. I can achieve it because I like challenges and it fills a hole in my martial arts knowledge.

    This will be achieved by: Oct 2  
    The reward will be: A Gi

1. 2 months of power lifting at the gym

    I will go to the gym 3 times a week during lunch and buy salad next door for lunch and I will train for ~45 min. I can achieve it because I've done it before and I felt good about it. I will go to either kampsportcentret's gym or to place near work.

    This will be achieved by: Oct 30  
    The reward will be: New training shorts

1. 100 kg deadlift 5x5, 75 kg bench 5x5, 85 kg squat 5x5

    I have reached comparable results before and with dedicated training I should be able to go beyond previous results. A couple of months with lunch gym training should be enough. To combat the grip issue I will bring a grip trainer to work.

    This will be achieved by: Nov 27  
    The reward will be: 

1. Side split with both feet besides the yoga mat

    I have knowledge about the theory and I will implement a good routine. By forcing light stretching several times a week and one hard training each week improvements should be constant. The main motivation is to get into the habit of relaxing at a stretched position to remove the groin pain once and for all.

    This will be achieved by: Dec 25  
    The reward will be: 

Benefits
--------

The main benefits:

1. Happier about myself.
1. More energy in my life.
1. Remove the dissatisfaction I've had the last years about not having exercised enough.
1. Feel better when I'm better at martial arts.


Hobby Projects
==============

The goal is to get going with some hobby projects.

1. Build a 3x3 LED cube.

    The goal is to get started with soldering. Should be a small project and an hour here or there should be enough to see it through.

    This will be achieved by: Aug 10  
    The reward will be: New wallet

1. Go through *Programming Phoenix* and *Programming Elixir*

    I think I want to learn more about web development and I've heard a ton of good stuff about Phoenix and Elixir.

    This will be achieved by: Sep 15  
    The reward will be: 

1. Construct a custom keyboard

    Too long have I had two GH60 PCB and a bunch of keycaps lying around. I'm still missing a plate but with that (and possibly stabilizers) I have all that it takes to finalize it. The soldering and the assembly shouldn't be too though and a custom keyboard is something I've wanted for a long time.

    This will be achieved by: Nov 30  
    The reward will be: 

1. Create a usable budgeting tool on par with my currently used system

    This will be achieved by:  
    The rewad wil be: 

Benefits
--------

1. Expanded knowledge.
1. For professional reasons and peace of mind I need to regularly work on hobby projects.
1. The satisfaction of completing projects should be very big.
1. Big geek achievement to have a custom keyboard.
