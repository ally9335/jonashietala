My relationship with my [Neovim config][] is best described as a [On-again, off-again relationship][].
At times I'm deeply in love and spend all my time caressing the config---like how in September I [did a complete rewrite in Lua][]---while other times I'm busy with other love interests and the config is left alone, sometimes for months or even years.

While not as intense as the September affair, I recently got back together with my config to migrate her from the "old and boring" [lazy.nvim][] package manager to the new and exciting [rocks.nvim][].
It wasn't all smooth sailing but with some patience---and a drink or two---our threesome with [rocks.nvim][] was quite enjoyable.

There's nothing wrong with [lazy.nvim][]---it's great.\
Sometimes I just want to try out new things.

# Why [rocks.nvim][]?

To be honest, the biggest reason I started looking into [rocks.nvim][] was that my brain---for some weird reason---tends to _get stuck_ thinking of things.
Rewriting my config wasn't something I wanted to do but it's not easy to escape when the brain has locked onto something.

Luckily, this time my brain locked onto something a little productive as [rocks.nvim][] has some nice and ambitious features.

## Benefits over other package managers

A. Avoids manual dependency management.

   With other package managers you as a user have to specify the dependencies for the plugin.
   Using [lazy.nvim][] it might look like this:

   ```lua
   return {
     "NeogitOrg/neogit",
      dependencies = {
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
        "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
      },
      opts = opts,
   }
   ```

   There are several issues with this:

   1. It's annoying.
   1. You need to babysit the config if the plugin adds or removes a dependency.
   1. The plugin might break if there's a breaking change in a dependency.
   1. What if you have several plugins that depend on a different version of a dependency?
      (You're going to have a bad time.)

   [rocks.nvim][] moves the dependency management to the plugin, so we can just specify the plugin itself:

   {path="rocks.toml"}
   ```toml
   "neo-tree.nvim" = "3.26"
   ```

   This makes plugin management easier and together with [SemVer][] versioning should reduce the risk of plugins breaking after updating them.

[Neovim config]: https://github.com/treeman/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim
[SemVer]: https://semver.org/

A. [rocks.nvim][] supports loading Lua packages from [luarocks][].

   Lua is a neat little language but it's very bare-bones and doesn't include a large standard library.
   Neovim has been incorporating more and more utility functions---such as `vim.split` and `vim.fs.joinpath()`---but there are still plenty of functionality that we need to import.
   That's why utility plugins such as [plenary.nvim][] exists and is a dependency to a lot of different plugins.

   With [luarocks][] you get access to many more libraries; for example a [yaml][] and a [toml][] library that would've saved my [from parsing them with a regex][toml-regex].

In short, [rocks.nvim][] behaves like you'd expect a package manager to behave if you come from an ecosystem blessed with modern package management (such as Cargo for Rust or Mix for Elixir).

## Drawbacks compared to [lazy.nvim][]

Naturally, it's not all fun and games and there are drawbacks to [rocks.nvim][] compared to [lazy.nvim][]:

a. Most plugins don't have a rockspec that define their dependencies, meaning you still need to manage the dependencies yourself, forgoing the biggest benefit of [rocks.nvim][].

a. Installing and updating packages feels slower.

a. You must manage lazy loading manually. I've seen rumors of lazy loading support for [rocks.nvim][] but as I'm writing this post there's nothing released yet.

a. [rocks.nvim][] is newer than [lazy.nvim][]; meaning less fancy features, more bugs, and more rough edges.

While I think that [rocks.nvim][] is taking a necessary and difficult step forward for Neovim package managers, there are valid reasons to still stick with [lazy.nvim][].

# Basic setup

You can install [rocks.nvim][] by manually sourcing an installer script but I wanted [rocks.nvim][] to install itself automatically.
It's possible by dropping [the bootstrap script][] into your `init.lua` file.

Then you're good to go with managing plugins with the `:Rocks` commands:

- `:Rocks install {rock}` to install a package.
- `:Rocks sync` to sync packages with `rocks.toml`.
- `:Rocks update` to update packages _and_ their versions in `rocks.toml`.
- `:Rocks prune {rock}` to uninstall a package.

I was a bit surprised that you can't update or sync an individual package but otherwise the commands feel intuitive.

## Separate config file per plugin

One feature I _really_ like about [lazy.nvim][] is the ability to separate plugin configuration into separate files.
This is easy to setup in [rocks.nvim][] using [rocks-config.nvim][].

1. Run `:Rocks install rocks-config.nvim` or edit `rocks.toml` manually:

   {path="rocks.toml"}
   ```toml
   [plugins]
   "rocks-config.nvim" = "1.6.0"
   ```

2. Create a plugin-specific file at `lua/plugins/<plugin-name>.lua` with the plugin setup and configuration code.

   For example, we can install [conform.nvim][] with `:Rocks install conform.nvim` and configure it in `lua/plugins/conform.lua`:

   {path="lua/plugins/conform.lua"}
   ```lua
   require("conform").setup({
     formatters_by_ft = {
       lua = { "stylua" }
     }
   })
   ```

   ::: note
   There are [some rules][config-rules] on what to name the config file:

   * The plugin's name (as long as it is a valid module name).
   * The plugin's name with the `.[n]vim` suffix removed.
   * The plugin's name with the `[n]vim-` prefix removed.
   * The plugin's name with `-` substituted for `.`.

   For [conform.nvim][] we could name the config file `conform-nvim.lua` or simply `conform.lua`.
   :::

Something to keep in mind when migrating to a setup with a config file per plugin is a potential ordering issue.
I for example use [mason-lspconfig.nvim][] for my LSP setup and it's important to call the setup in the right order:

1. Setup [mason.nvim][].
2. Setup [mason-lspconfig.nvim][].
3. Setup [lspconfig][].

If the plugins have their own config file then we can't guarantee this order.
We can instead setup them all in one of the config files---although I'm not a fan of commingling setup of different plugins in a single file in `lua/plugins`, I prefer them to have a 1-to-1 relationship with a plugin.
I think it's cleaner to place such a file in a runtimepath such as `plugin/lspconfig.lua`.
 

## Git dependencies

Another crucial feature is the ability to install plugins from git repositories.
This requires the [rocks-git.nvim][] module that's installed with `:Rocks install rocks-git.nvim`:


{path="rocks.toml"}
```toml
[plugins]
"rocks-git.nvim" = "1.5.1"
```

You can then add git dependencies using `:Rocks install <git-path>` or add them to `rocks.toml` manually:

{path="rocks.toml"}
```toml
[plugins]
"vim-fugitive" = { git = "tpope/vim-fugitive" }
"trouble.nvim" = { git = "folke/trouble.nvim", branch = "dev" }
"nvim-ts-autotag" = { git = "windwp/nvim-ts-autotag", rev = "aeb7090" }
```

As I'm writing this almost exactly half of my plugins in `rocks.toml` depends on a git repository instead of [luarocks][].
Mostly because they don't exist on [luarocks][] but I also have some Vimscript plugins that never will be.

# How to build a plugin?

There are some plugins that needs to be built before we can use them in Neovim.
[telescope-fzf-native][] is such an example where we need to run `make` after we clone the repository.
If this plugin was on [luarocks][] this would be managed seamlessly by [rocks.nvim][] but since the dependency is a git repository we need to build it ourselves.

I spent some time wondering how I should solve this but turns out it's as simple as adding a `build` option to the plugin:

{path="rocks.toml"}
```toml
"telescope-fzf-native.nvim" = { git = "nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim", build = "make" }
```

::: note
Before I discovered the `build` option I called `make` the hard way:

{path="after/plugin/telescope-fzf-native.lua"}
```lua
require("nio").run(function()
  local package_path =
    vim.fs.joinpath(
      vim.fn.stdpath("data"),
      "site/pack/rocks/start",
      "telescope-fzf-native.nvim/"
    )

  -- Before loading the extension we need to build it with `make`.
  require("nio").process.run({
    cmd = "make",
    args = {},
    cwd = package_path,
  })
  -- Now we can load the extension.
  require("telescope").load_extension("fzf")
end)
```

That's what you get if you skip the manual.

# Lazy loading

One big feature that [lazy.nvim][] promotes is lazy loading (it's even in the name!).
Unfortunately [rocks.nvim][] doesn't provide first-class support for lazy loading so we have to manage it ourselves.

## The problem with lazy loading

Before looking at how to implement lazy loading, I'd like to bring up a few problems with us lazy loading plugins.

a. It's easy to half-ass it.

   For example, with [lazy.nvim][] you can add commands and events that you want to lazy load on:

   ```lua
   {
     "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
     cmd = { "TSInstall", "TSUpdate" },
     event = { "BufReadPre", "BufNewFile" },
     config = config,
     build = ":TSUpdate",
   }
   ```

   But how do you know that you used the correct events and listed the right commands?
   And how do you keep up to date when a plugin adds or removes commands?

   I managed to get *really* agitated when I thought I'd messed up the treesitter installation when I couldn't call `:TSInstallInfo`, until I remembered that I hadn't registered that command to load [nvim-treesitter][]...

   ![[nvim-treesitter][] defines a lot of commands that we ideally should list when we setup lazy loading.](/images/extend_blog/treesitter_cmds.png)

a. Extra complexity.

   Earlier in this post I complained about having to [manage the dependencies for the plugins](#Benefits-over-other-package-managers) you install.
   When you lazy load a plugin you also need to specify commands and events you want to use for lazy load.

   And if you _really_ want to commit to lazy loading as many plugins as possible (I did!) you might end up with some pretty horrendous code, like how you'd lazy load [oil.nvim][]:

   ```lua
   {
     "stevearc/oil.nvim",
     dependencies = { "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" },
     opts = opts,
     command = "Oil",
     -- This is how to lazy load oil according to:
     -- https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/issues/533
     init = function()
       if vim.fn.argc() == 1 then
         local stat = vim.loop.fs_stat(vim.fn.argv(0))
         if stat and stat.type == "directory" then
           require("lazy").load({ plugins = { "oil.nvim" } })
         end
       end
       if not require("lazy.core.config").plugins["oil.nvim"]._.loaded then
         vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufNew", {
           callback = function()
             if vim.fn.isdirectory(vim.fn.expand("<afile>")) == 1 then
               require("lazy").load({ plugins = { "oil.nvim" } })
               -- Once oil is loaded, we can delete this autocmd
               return true
             end
           end,
         })
       end
     end,
   }
   ```

In general I think properly lazy loading should be the responsibility of the plugin, not us as users.

With that said, being able to lazy load plugins is a great feature when you need it.

## Packadd

On a basic level you can accomplish lazy loading by following these three steps:

1. Mark the plugin with `opt = true`lua.

   {path="rocks.toml"}
   ```toml
   [plugins]
   neorg = { version = "1.0.0", opt = true }
  ```

   This will prevent [rocks.nvim][] from sourcing the plugin at startup.

2. Add the plugin with `packadd`.

   ```lua
   vim.cmd("packadd neorg")
   ```

3. Setup and configure the plugin as needed.

Steps 2 and 3 should be done on-demand, for example via an autocommand:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "BufReadPre", "BufNewFile" }, {
  pattern = "*.norg",
  callback = function()
    vim.cmd("packadd neorg")
    require("neorg").setup()
    return true
  end,
})
```

## Lazy setup

{path="lua/config/lazy.lua"}
```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "BufReadPre", "BufNewFile" }, {
  pattern = "*",
  callback = function()
    require("lazy_plugins.lspconfig")
    return true
  end,
})
```

{path="lua/lazy_plugins/lspconfig.lua"}
```lua
require("elixir").setup({
  credo = {
    enable = true,
    capabilities = capabilities,
    on_attach = on_attach
  },
  elixirls = {
    enable = true,
    settings = require("elixir.elixirls").settings({
      dialyzerEnabled = true,
      enableTestLenses = true,
      suggestSpecs = true,
      fetchDeps = true,
    }),
    capabilities = capabilities,
    on_attach = on_attach,
  },
})

-- And other lsp related setup in the file.
```
