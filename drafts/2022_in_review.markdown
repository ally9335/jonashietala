A bit late, but it's time for my [yearly review][]. It's something I like doing for myself and it's nice to see that despite a tough year I've done some good things.

# 2022 Non-Geek Achievements

- We got our third child!

  This time we got a girl to complement our two boys, and I love them all more than anything. I wouldn't trade them for the world.

- Wrote [4 blog posts][blog posts].

# 2022 Geek Achievements

- [Rewrote the blog in Rust][rust-rewrite].
- Wrote more Rust (thanks to my job).
- Wrote some Typescript (again due to my job).
- Started home automation with [Home Assistant][].

  It started with us installing solar panels, and I wanted to get some pretty graphs from it to see how it performed.

  ![Pretty graphs in Grafana. Even though it's cold and snowy, we still produce some energy.](/images/solar.png)

  But it all went downhill from there...

  ![The core of my zigbee network connecting some lamps, plugs, switches and controls in our home.
  There are now 52 connected devices, and it will continue to grow.](/images/zigbee.png)

  There are still *tons* of things I want to implement, fix and play around with.
  I think it's best not to think of smart-home as some sort of money or time saver, but more as a hobby that might have some positive effects.


# Books I remember

- The [*Gentlemen Bastards Series*][bastards].

  Disgustingly evil and I've got another book to eternally wait for (like the now 12 year wait for *Winds of Winter*).

- [*The Power of Habit*][power] and [*Atomic Habits*][atomic].

  After reading these books I'm convinced that habits is the most powerful tool we humans have, and I need to be more conscious about them going forward. The Power of Habit is the more inspirational book, while Atomic Habits gives the blueprint of how to establish the habits you want.


# Boardgames I remember

- *[Spirit Island][]*

  I've never played a boardgame solo before, as I always identified boardgames with social interactions.
  But there's really no difference between playing a boardgame alone, versus playing a computer game alone.
  And I had an extremely good time playing Spirit Island.

- *[Great Western Trail][]*

  If you put me on the spot to name my current #1 boardgame, I'd have to give it to Great Western Trail.
  Such an amazingly well designed game.

- *[Obsession][]*

  Obsession is quite an unique game, and it might be the game I'm most glad of having in my collection.

- *[Clinic Deluxe Edition][]*

  A very thematic and chunky game about managing a hospital. I haven't played it a lot, but I can't wait to play it again.

- *[Netrunner][]*

  Many years ago I used to play a ton of Netrunner and went to tournaments and stuff, and to this day Netrunner has given me the best boardgaming memories of all time.

  Unfortunately it became a bit too much and I got burnt out from [the Mumbad Cycle meta][mumbad], so I took a break to focus on other things, and then Fantasy Flight stopped developing the game. A sad ending to a great game.

  Or so I thought. The fan organization [Null Signal Games][] (previously Nisei) has continued to support the game and has continued to release new cards for Netrunner, keeping the game alive and well.

  This is super exciting, and in many ways their releases are even better than Fantasy Flights (less useless cards, more coherent releases and less game-breaking interactions). So I bought all the new cards (I kind of regret selling my complete collection a couple of years ago) and I hope I get to play with them sometime.

- *[Radlands][]*

  A quick and fantastic two player card game. If a lifestyle game like Netrunner is too much, Radlands is the perfect alternative.

- *[Carcassonne][]* and *[Dragomino][]*

  To my eternal joy, my oldest kid has been enjoying gaming more and more, and both me and him have been loving Carcassonne and Dragomino.


# 2022 Misadventures

- Got depressed and burnt-out

# Plans for 2023

- Spend more time with my kids

- Reduce the boardgame list-of-shame that (I think) consists of 12 games that I own but have never played.

  A more daunting task than it might seem as it's been very hard to get time for gaming, and I'm waiting for something like 10+ crowdfunding games to arrive in 2023. Oops.

- Finish the digital version of [my book][whycrypto].

  The plan was to finish it last year so I could move on to other projects, but if I don't finish it now it might never be done. Therefore I'll dedicate the spring to finally finalize it.

- Establish Deep Work as my keystone habit.

- Play games instead of doom scrolling on the phone or lazily watch TV.

- More focus on health, both psychological and physical.
