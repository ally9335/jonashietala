This is an update to the [T-34][] keyboard layout I've been using for a few months. While there are still changes I'd like to try, I'm quite pleased with these changes so I figured I might as well immortalize them before I change my mind.


# The repeat key

The big change to the layout is the `Repeat` key. The concept is simple: when you press it you repeat the last pressed key.

The first usage I'm aware of is the [IRST][] layout which the repeat key to lower the same finger usage. So for example to type "call" you'd type `c` `a` `l` `Repeat`, avoiding the double click on `l`. It's not as bad as pressing a key on the home-row and then directly after pressing a key on the top-row with the same finger, but it's still slightly annoying (especially with the pinky).

So how common is the `Repeat` key? I tried to use my code corpus to see:

While the `Repeat` key is common, it does not qualify for the top 10 and so it does not out compete `Space` or `e` as a thumb key. (`Space` isn't listed in the graph so `d` comes in at 10th place.) This makes it quite tough to place.

But it's usefulness isn't only on minimizing SFB, as it can easily repeat difficult keys as well. For instance I have many two- or three-key combos, and double tapping them are *not* pleasant. I tried to solve this by holding them down to simulate double or triple taps, but with a repeat key I can just do `combo` + `Repeat`. Feels very good!

Or I can repeat modded keys. For instance to exit Elixir's REPL iex you need to do `Ctrl` + `c` twice.

Changes

- Rotate `y`, `k`, `j`, `p`

  To have `j` and `k` (up/down in Vim) in slightly better positons and to fix the troublesome `sys` and `bj` pairs.

- Swap `a` and `i`/`u`

- Rotate `.`, `,` and move away `=`, `"` to make space for `Repeat` and `/` on base.

  The big goal here was to add the `Repeat` key (more on that bad boy later).

- `sc` combo to fix bigram

- Rollling `u` `Repeat` outputs `ui` to fix bigram


# Combos

New/altered combos:

`q` and `qu`

                                    Top Right           Res
----------          -----           ------------        --------
                                    `w` + `Repeat`      `=`
                                       `u` + `,`        `Reverse repeat`
**Home Left**       **Res**        
`s` +   `h`             `"`            
`s` + `t` + `h`           `;`           

Reverse Repeat, bidirectional pairs:

A                   B
--------------      ----------------
`Ctrl` `n`          `Ctrl` `p`
`*`                 `#`
`Ctrl` `o`          `Ctrl` `i`
`W`                 `B`

Any other letter, pressing `Reverse Repeat` output the previous letter + `a`. This is

Changes to the symbols layers:

- `@` `Repeat` `.` `,` `"` `/` `=`


# Tap hold

Tap             Hold
-----           ------      -----
`|`             ` || `      One hold saves 4 key strokes for these common operators
`&`             ` && `
`=`             ` == `
`!`             ` != `
`@`             `@u`        Vim: Execute macro stored in `u`, to be paired with the `qu` combo
`?`             `{:?}`      Rust debug print
`#`             `{:#?}`     Rust debug pretty print
`%`             `%{}`       A map in Elixir


# What do I dislike?

- `p` is in *the* worst spot on the keyboard.
- Having `space` combo all symbols is a bit weird as the left mod only covers symbols on the right side, and it messes up my head. I'm considering to change so that `space` + key on the left = number and `space` + key on the right = symbol, and the reverse for `e`.
- `Repeat` being on the same column as `a` and `5` isn't ideal, but I see no better alternative.
