Two sets of changes:

- Rotate `y`, `k`, `j`, `p`

  To have `j` and `k` (up/down in Vim) in slightly better positons and to fix the troublesome `sys` and `bj` pairs.
- Rotate `.`, `,` and move away `=`, `"` to make space for `Repeat` and `/` on base.

  The big goal here was to add the `Repeat` key (more on that bad boy later).

New/altered combos:

                                    Top Right           Res
----------          -----           ------------        --------
                                    `w` + `Repeat`      `=`
                                       `u` + `,`        `Reverse repeat`
**Home Left**       **Res**        
`s` +   `h`             `"`            
`s` + `t` + `h`           `;`

Changes to the symbols layers:

- `|` and `&` next to `Repeat`
- `@` and `#` take their spots
