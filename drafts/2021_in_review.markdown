A new year is always a good time to review the past year. Funny how this is already [the 12<sup>th</sup> year][previous years] I've done this kind of quick review... Time sure flies.


# 2021 Non-Geek Achievements

0. Started strength training using a strength coach from [Kabuki][].

    I got inspired by the book [Peak][peak] that makes the case for the efficiency of having an experienced coach guide your skill development, and I decided to try out the virtual coaching. I get help with designing a program and checking my form. So far it's been great.

0. Wrote [8 blog posts][blog posts].
0. Started the re-read of [The First Law][abercrombie] series and the other books in the universe.

    The stand-alone books *Best Served Cold* and *The Heroes* are seriously great (haven't gotten to *Read Country* yet).


# 2021 Geek Achievements

0. Got a lot of funding for an open-source project that I've been working on.
0. Wrote a bunch of Rust.

    Bought a bunch of Rust programming books too, but the only one I've read through is *Programming Rust*, which was good.

0. Wrote a lot of Elixir.

    Also read a bunch of Elixir books. *Elixir in Action* was bloody fantastic.

0. Wrote some C, Python, Typescript and probably something else too.
0. Started using a (very) [custom keyboard layout][t-34] on a 34-key split keyboard.
0. Did some web design.

    The book *The Non-Designer's Design Book* is great for design-fledglings like me.

- *Vital Lacerda*. **On Mars**, **The Gallerist** and **Vinhos**.
