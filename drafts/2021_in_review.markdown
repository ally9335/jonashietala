A new year is always a good time to review the past year. Funny how this is already [the 12<sup>th</sup> year][previous years] I've done this kind of quick review... Time sure flies.


# 2021 Non-Geek Achievements

0. Started strength training using a strength coach from [Kabuki][].

    I got inspired by the book [Peak][peak] that makes the case for the efficiency of having an experienced coach guide your skill development, and I decided to try out the virtual coaching. I get help with designing a program and checking my form. So far it's been great.

0. Wrote [8 blog posts][blog posts].
0. Started the re-read of [The First Law][abercrombie] series and the other books in the universe.

    The stand-alone books *Best Served Cold* and *The Heroes* are seriously great (haven't gotten to *Read Country* yet).


# 2021 Geek Achievements

0. Got a lot of funding for an open-source project that I've been working on.
0. Wrote a bunch of Rust.

    Bought a bunch of Rust programming books too, but the only one I've read through is *Programming Rust*, which was good.

0. Wrote a lot of Elixir.

    Also read a bunch of Elixir books. *Elixir in Action* was bloody fantastic.

0. Wrote some C, Python, Typescript and probably something else too.
0. Started using a (very) [custom keyboard layout][t-34] on a 34-key split keyboard.
0. Did some web design.

    The book *The Non-Designer's Design Book* is great for design-fledglings like me.

## Boardgames I remember

- *Vital Lacerda* is famous for designing thematic and very complex Eurogames. Some hate them, others maintain that they're the best things since sliced bread and I lean towards the latter.

    I bought and played three of them:

    0. **On Mars** is very complex with a lot of rules (it took me ~30 min to explain them, even though I skipped a bunch and came prepared). Still, it's an absolutely amazing game and it was the highlight of the year for me.
    0. **The Gallerist** is also on the complex side, but I still find it very approachable. Also an amazing game and I find it's very difficult to decide between it and On Mars.
    0. I only played **Vinhos** once. While it's undoubtedly a very good game, it has taken a step back compared to the two other Lacerdas. I'd like to play it more.

- **Food Chain Magnate** is easily one of my favorite games of all time, and I got to play a game with the new milestones from the **Ketchup** expansion. And what can I say? It was great, and if you want more variation to the game the expansion is fantastic.

- My kid is now 4 years old and at long last he's old enough to play some decent board games. Both me and him liked [Animal Upon Animal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17329/animal-upon-animal) and [Rhino Hero](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91514/rhino-hero), which are fun enough to play with adults as well!

## New mangas/manwhas I remember

- SSS-Class Suicide Hunter, Omniscent Reader's Viewpoint (smart MCs)
- Legend of the Northern Blade (truly amazing martial arts manwha)
- The Beginning After the End, Volcanic Age (great regression stories)
- Murim Login (martial arts + humor)
