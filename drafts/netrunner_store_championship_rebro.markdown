## Round 1: Bye

I got a bye (or default win or whatever) as my opponent was late. I wasn't very happy about it as I came here to play as much netrunner as possible but luckily Frida from Örebro had a game with me. I also felt sorry for my opponent who was at most 5 minutes late but impressively he managed to get 3rd and managed to qualify despite this setback!

4 points

## Round 2: Harald, Jesminder/NEH

I met my Linköping partner Harald at the top table, playing beneath a camera for the first time. During one of the first turns I distinctly remember looking at my shaking hand. I managed to compose myself and play a decent enough game but I'm not quite looking forward to the replay... I'm sure I made many dumb plays.

Killed with Hiro/Neural/Ronin as runner wasn't aggressively checking my cards.

Got a nice start with Noise, free Medium and got corp down on credits.

8 points, 2-0

## Round 3: Mattias, Chaos Theory/Replicating Perfection

Runner checked all my cards, ran archives, won psychic field psi game and siphoned me down. Was too aggressive with installing Hiro early (runner checked immediately).

Noise has a great matchup against RP. Just sit back and build up, challenge remote (loose psi game) but keep on building/milling. He got a nisei scored and other one upcoming but milled enough agendas to win.

10 points, 3-1

## Round 4: Yoshi, Whizzard/EtF

The second filmed game. Got a great start against Whizzard as I installed assets until he couldn't/wouldn't keep up trashing them. Finally built up to kill with Hiro/Neural/Ronin. The chance of winning was 2/3 otherwise I could just install over Hiro and continue with scoring out.

Ran against remote, clicked through turing and trash adonis. Directly after ran on R&D with a medium, but didn't find anything, and gimped my game from there on out. He played correctly and rushed out before I could get properly set up again. Was too aggressive early on without Wyldsyde/Aesop's.

12 points, 4-1

## Round 5: Magnus, Noise/NEH

Played a slug of a game against Noise. He got a bunch of agendas and was on the verge of victory a bunch of times. I found my three jackssons in time to save agendas from the archives and I dodged some deep medium digs. When he lamprey locked me (repeatedly!) I managed to hold on and somehow he had run out his deck. He made a last deep dig and hit a snare with 2 cards in hand. But he played well and with the number of accesses I feel he should have won.

NEH was another slog. Now it was my turn to get some deep medium digs and then I slowed down the game with clot. At the end of the game we had a bunch of spectators which was quite stressful... I misplayed a little bit at the end when I ran on archives on my 3rd click (he had yet another Jackson!) and HQ on my 4th to find the last agenda of a 1/5 chance. If I didn't get it he would've won the next turn. Again it felt a bit undeserving but I'll take it I guess.

16 points, 6-2
