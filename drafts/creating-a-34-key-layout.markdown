title: "My 34-key keyboard layout"
tags: Computer, Keyboards

A couple of months ago I started looking into ergonomical keyboards; mainly split keyboards with much fewer keys, like the [36-key Gergoplex][GergoPlex] and the [44-key Kyria][Kyria]. I may write another post about the reasons why, but long story short I started getting pain in my thumbs, fingers, wrist and forearm and I thought it was time to do something about it.

Because my new shiny layout has been unchanged for more than a week, I've clearly found my Ultimate Layoutâ„¢ and it's time to immortalize it with a blog post!


# Why a new layout?

When I first wanted to use a split keyboard I tried to use a standard QWERTY layout, but I got super annoyed as I kept trying to press some keys "with the wrong hand". For instance, on a regular keyboard, `B` is right in the middle and I've always pressed it with the right hand, but on a split keyboard it's on the left.

So I thought, if I'm already this annoyed, why not completely switch the layout while I'm at it? It's something I've thought about before, but never been bothered.

And QWERTY is just a really bad layout in general, no matter what metrics you choose. Minimizing finger movement is why I wanted to use a smaller keyboard, and in QWERTY you move your fingers *a lot*, so it just made sense for me to choose a layout that minimizes finger movement as well.


# First there was BEAKL

When you start looking at it, there are **tons** of good and interesting layouts. Here are just some I've looked at:

* [Dvorak][]
* [Workman][]
* [Colemak Mod-DH][]
* [Hands Down][]
* [MTGAP 2.0][]
* BEAKL (many variants)
* And many others...

They all have their pros and cons, and which one you prefer is subjective. For example Colemak optimizes for home-row usage and Mod-DH tries to fix some of it's problems, while MTGAP optimizes for rolls and BEAKL penalizes pinkies.

In the end I chose [BEAKL 15][], mostly because I liked the discussion on the now defunct BEAKL forums, and I had some strain on my right pinky that I wanted to minimize.

Although the layout felt much better than qwerty, after trying out a bunch of modifications I've since moved away from BEAKL. At around 50 WPM I got increasingly annoyed at the high same finger usage (called SFU). At the same time I found that I wanted to use my pinkies more than BEAKL was designed for, which could be used to address the high SFU.
