# Preparations

* Is there an idea for the cover?
* Describe elements and ideas _in detail_
* Examples of art styles I have in mind
* Examples of covers in the same genre (in my case none of them were that impressive)

# Hiring a designer

# Working with the designer

* Communication is the absolutely most important thing
* What did you like? What didn't you like? And _wny_?
* Should be an iterative process
