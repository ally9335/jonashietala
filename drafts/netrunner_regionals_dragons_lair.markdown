## Match 1, Argus/Ken

vs Argus

Fails a sea source scorche, medium dig for the win.

vs Ken

Faceplants a tsurugi with 2 cards in hand.

2-0, 4 prestige


## Match 2, Whizzard/Etf

vs Whizzard

Does the right thing: trashes everything and denies my money.

vs Etf

Got an early agenda but he sneaks out an utopia fragment. Downhill from there with rock solid play.

2-2, 4 prestige


## Match 3, Leela/RP

3-3, 6 prestige

vs Leela

Agenda flood, mulligan into an even worse agenda flood. Trying to draw but finds more agendas... Throw them into archives but he's aggressive and runs there, my hand and R&D. Almost stabilize but he finds the final agenda on top of R&D.


## Match 4, Ken/PE

vs Ken

Standard lockout. Snare in R&D for a flatline win.

vs PE

Die to a junebug. God I'm so stupid.

4-4, 8 prestige


## Match 5, Val/RP

vs Valencia

Get a nice lockdown going, getting some money and solidly score out.

vs RP

Trash all the thing. He got agenda flooded. Access things and win.

6-4, 12 prestige


## Match 6, RP/Valencia

vs RP

A long slog of a match... Steal an egenda to remove ELP, then get ELP again. Repeat once more. Should have prepared more to trash sundew in scoring remote earlier. Was very close in the end.

vs Valencia

Only 15 minutes remaining, I try to rush out agendas. I manage to rush out a 3-pointer, but fail to purge and he wins by R&D. On time!

6-6, 12 prestige
