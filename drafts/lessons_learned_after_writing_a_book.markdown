# Writing is a skill

A good writer isn't born; a good writer is created

[writing-well]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well



## Remove unnecessary words

## Keep it simple stupid

## Practice

## Keep it personal

Don't be afraid to use strong wording

Use personal opinions. There's nothing wrong with "you" and "in my opinion".

# Consistency is the most important thing

# Rewrite, rewrite, rewrite

# Clarity of thought translates into clear writing

# Have a plan and an outline

# Get a proof-reader or two

# Perfectionism is a blessing and a curse
