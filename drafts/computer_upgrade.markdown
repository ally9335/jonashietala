After 5 years or so I've made a large upgrade to my desktop, and this post contains some details and some pictures about the process.

# It was time

I didn't really want to do an upgrade right now, but I felt I had to do it.
Sometimes the lag had gotten very noticeable, for example when running multiple Neovim instances with several different LSPs in Rust and Elixir.

That was frustrating, but the biggest reason was this ghastly discovery in my liquid cooling loop:

If you can't spot it (no shame on you), there's a huge ball of garbage that's stuck hanging down beneath the graphics card, and it almost seems like it's blocking the liquid from passing through properly.

I *know* that you're supposed to check on your loop once a year or so.
But things just sort of happened.
We moved, I worked and we got three kids.
Sometimes it's just hard to take time for these things, but now I just had to do it or I might not have a computer left to work on.

# The new things

- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen 9 7950X
- **RAM**: Kingston 32GB DDR5 5200MHz CL40 FURY
- **Motherboard**: ASRock B650 PG Lightning
- **Fans**: 8x Noctua NF-A14 PWM 140mm
- **SSD**: Kingston KC3000 M.2 2280 NVMe SSD 2TB
- **Water cooling**: New tubing, fitting, a large reservoir and probably something more

Taking apart the computer is a pain, so I decided to do an upgrade as well.
I landed on a Ryzen 9 7950X, a beast of a CPU that should leave me with no slowness complaints (well, as few as possible I guess).
With that I also had to get a new motherboard and new DDR5 RAM memory.

The fans were some gravy as some of the old fans occasionally stopped spinning and the SSD was just an impulse buy (it was big, fast and cheap).

I redid the water cooling loop a little as well.
The position of the reservoir/pump combo wasn't good and I wanted to try to get a position for better airflow.

# It's... Not perfect

Despite my best efforts of planning the loop, the drain system ended up sucking.
While I managed to drain most of the liquid, there some parts like the lower rad and the reservoir the liquid got stuck, and I had to resort to flipping the computer upside down to get rid of it.

# It's alive

TODO should take new pictures with drain management and new fans
