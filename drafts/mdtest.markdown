# Header 1 (h2)

Something

## Header 2 (h3)

Others

### Header 3 (h4)

Consider having your front door locked for example. You could consider your home secure if your door is locked and insecure if it’s open but that doesn’t say what you’re secure against. It’s missing context. It might prevent opportunistic thefts but a more determined attacker could instead break a window, pick the lock of the door or simply break down the door itself. [Maybe you live in a neighborhood](#) with lots of thefts and you might want an alarm system, a dog or iron bars over your windows.

At the same time it might not be practical to go all out and get the best protection possible. You might not want to give up your life and move to a bunker where your friends can’t visit and a private security force may be slightly too expensive.

So we should do `foo` then `bar` then `quux`

This text is **bold**. This is *italicized*. This is ***both*** `Here's some code.`.

# First Header

Quotes are "cool". Or are they 'cool'? 1234567890

> Just a normal quote. Where some dude says something smart.  
> And the next line.

Some other text

> First level of quoting.
>
> > This is a nested blockquote
>
> Hmm  
> Back to the first level.

## Second Header ##

Unordered list:

* Milk
* Bread
* Cheese

    Paragraph

* Rice

Ordered list:

1. Milk
2. Bread
3. Cheese
5. Rice

    Can also have some text here
    But then the paragraph destroys?

6. Pew  
    This is closer  
    To what I want?

| The limerick packs laughs anatomical
| In space that is quite economical.
|    But the good ones I've seen
|    So seldom are clean
| And the clean ones so seldom are comical

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
