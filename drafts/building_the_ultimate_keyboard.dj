# Prototypes

When you're trying to design something like a custom keyboard I think you need to go through a bunch of trial-and-error until you find something that fits.
I went through several iterations where I made small tweaks and tried new things.

## First print

{% v2 %}

For my first print I mostly wanted to print it out and test how a keyboard with a standard curvature felt.
I also wanted to try to place a trackball somewhere.

I ended up removing a regular thumb key (I've used two thumb keys with my [keyboard layout](/series/t-34)) to make it fit and I added a "mouse thumb key" that I plan to use as a `left mouse button` when I'm operating the trackball.

Another tweak I made was to reduce the spacing between the keys to be closer to the Choc spacing.
Choc spacing seems to be 18.6 mm x 17.6 mm, but I used a 19 mm x 18 mm spacing; the attraction to round numbers is real.

Please ignore the bad print quality; the filament was wet and the temperature was too high---it's just a prototype so it really doesn't matter.](/images/cosmos/v2_proto.jpg)

The left half of the keyboard won't have a trackball and I might instead add some extra keys to it.

It has an extra row with two keys instead of a trackball (a default Dactyl Manuform config).](/images/cosmos/v2_left.png)

But because the [Cosmos][] configurator currently doesn't manage different layouts for the left and right halves I plan to first tweak the right side and then convert that into the left side.

## Pressing the top right key with the ring finger

{% v3 %}

Most of the keys on the keyboard felt fine but I had one major annoyance: 
I have a habit of using the ring finger to press the top right key instead of the pinky but with the curvature on the keyboard this just wasn't possible anymore.

You might wonder, why don't I just create a new habit and use the pinky _as you're supposed to_?
The simple answer is that I *hate* it.
To my fingers that feels beyond terrible and I'd rather remove the key and only have two keys in the outermost column.
As it happens, pressing the key with my ring finger (on a flat keyboard) feels good so I'd rather adjust the key than remove it.

That's the beauty of designing a custom keyboard for yourself---you can do weird shit that only makes sense to you.

## v5

{% v4 + v5 %}

- Moved mouse thumb keys (they were in the way)
- Added an extra mouse pinky key
- Bought PRO so I could try the wrist rest
