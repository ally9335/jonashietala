When you see the description "the ultimate keyboard", what do you think about?

There are _many_ keyboards in this world; here are some that I could come up with that might fit the "ultimate" moniker:

- [Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate mechanical keyboard][das-ultimate]
- [DataHand][]
- [Ergodox EZ][ergo-ez]
- [Glove80][g80]
- [Happy Hacking Keyboard][hhkb]
- [Model M Keyboard][model-m]
- [Stenotype][] keyboards.
- [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard][uhk]
- [CharaChorder][]

Some even have "ultimate" in their name, although I'll assert that they're far from ultimate.

> Any man who must say, "I am the King", is no true king.
> ^ Tywin Lannister

I'll go one step further to say that no keyboard is universally the ultimate because it's impossible to agree on how to rank different keyboards.
For example, while I personally prefer a split keyboard, you might not;
some people have very long fingers and some have very short fingers making some layouts more comfortable than others.
Others may not even have 10 fingers (or both hands), requiring more drastic modifications.

If an ultimate keyboard exists, it differs from person to person.

# My wishlist

To me, the ultimate keyboard should have these features:

a. Should be split to support a more natural typing position.

   Really the biggest ergonomical leap in my opinion.

a. Customized for my own fingers and typing eccentricities.

   Column stagger, curvatures and tenting are features I think I want but they need to be tuned, probably by trial-and-error.
   The position of the thumb keys is another sticking point that the other keyboards I've tried have failed to get right.

a. Have an integrated trackball or trackpad.

   This way I don't have to move my hand so far and I can free up some valuable desk space.
   It also must not be operated by the thumb due to my RSI.

a. Contain the keys I need but no more.

   I like smaller keyboards and I've been very happy and with [my custom keyboard layout][t34] that only has 34 keys.
   Some modifications are fine of course.

With these requirements I need to be able to customize all parts of the keyboard and I really don't want to learn CAD and create one from scratch; I wonder what alternatives I have?

# [Cosmos][] keyboard configurator

Having looked around, I probably want something similar to a [Dactyl][] / [Dactyl Manuform][] (many variants exists).
They're keyboards you generate from parameters (such as number of rows and columns and the amount of curvature).
I've always wanted to try one---now when I [have a 3D printer](/series/voron_trident) I can.

When looking for a generator I stumbled upon the [Cosmos keyboard configurator][Cosmos] and I want to gush about it a little because {=it's excellent=}.

![A relatively standard Dactyl Manuform with an encoder and trackpad.](/images/cosmos/cosmos_config.png)

It's excellent because it allows a clueless sod like me to configure a keyboard the way I want to.
Not to mention an impressive feature list:

1. Easily generate keyboards of any size.
1. Customize XY-spacing, row- and colomn curvature, and more.
1. Several pre-made thumb clusters.
1. UI to move around all thumb keys.
1. Supports different switches (I so need my Choc switches).
1. An `Expert` mode that allows you to customize anything that doesn't have UI support. For example to add or move individual keys.
1. Can generate a wrist rest.
1. Supports encoders, trackpads, OLED displays, and trackballs.
1. Exports `.stl` for easy printing or `.step` you can import to CAD.

In the `Expert` mode you lose the nice UI but you can instead customize the keyboard using Javascript.
Here's a small snippet from the tool:

```javascript
const curvature = {
  curvatureOfColumn: 15,
  curvatureOfRow: 5,
  spacingOfRows: 18, // 18x19 Choc spacing
  spacingOfColumns: 19,
  arc: 0,
};

/**
 * Useful for setting a different curvature
 * for the pinky keys.
 */
const pinkyCurvature = {
  ...curvature,
  curvatureOfColumn: 15,
};

/**
 * The plane used to position the upper keys.
 * It's rotated by the tenting and x rotation
 * then translated by the z offset.
 */
const upperKeysPlane = new Trsf()
   // `20` specifies the tenting angle.
  .rotate(20, [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], false)
  .rotate(1, [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0], false)
  .translate(0, 0, 0, false);
```

The entire state of the keyboard is also stored in the url, so I can easily share my config by [including a link][v3].
(Barring any breaking changes in the tool of course...)

# Prototypes

When you're trying to design something like a custom keyboard I think you need to go through a bunch of trial-and-error until you find something that fits.
I went through several iterations where I made small tweaks and tried new things.

## First print

{% v2 %}

For my first print I mostly wanted to print it out and test how a keyboard with a standard curvature felt.
I also wanted to try to place a trackball somewhere.

I ended up removing a regular thumb key (I've used two thumb keys with my [keyboard layout](/series/t-34)) to make it fit and I added a "mouse thumb key" that I plan to use as a `left mouse button` when I'm operating the trackball.
It was tricky to place the trackball as I wanted to operate it with my index + middle finger, not my thumb.

Another tweak I made was to reduce the spacing between the keys to be closer to the Choc spacing.
Choc spacing seems to be 18.6 x 17.6 mm, but I used 19 x 18 mm spacing---the attraction to round numbers is real.

![This is the very first prototype I printed.
Please ignore the bad print quality; the filament was wet and the temperature was too high. It's just a prototype so it really doesn't matter.](/images/cosmos/v2_proto.jpg)

Because the [Cosmos][] configurator currently doesn't handle different layouts for the left and right halves I plan to first tweak the right side and then convert that into the left side.

[Cosmos reference][v2-ball],

## Pressing the top right key with the ring finger

{% v3 %}

Most of the keys on the keyboard felt fine but I had one major annoyance: 
I have a habit of using the ring finger to press the top right key instead of the pinky but with the curvature on the keyboard this just wasn't possible anymore.

You might wonder, why don't I just create a new habit and use the pinky _as you're supposed to_?
The simple answer is that I *hate* it.
To my fingers that feels beyond terrible and I'd rather remove the key and only have two keys in the outermost column.
As it happens, pressing the key with my ring finger (on a flat keyboard) feels good so I'd rather adjust the key than remove it.

::: important
That's the beauty of designing a custom keyboard for yourself---you can do weird shit that only makes sense to you.
:::

![The second printed prototype, with some keys installed for testing.
The printer clogged before the print was finished but it did its job as a prototype.](/images/cosmos/v3_proto.jpg)

![Here's an angle from the configurator showing the offset of the `p` key compared the other keys in the column.](/images/cosmos/v3_p_ring_finger.png)

I also added an extra mouse thumb key and lowered the pinky column a bit.

[Cosmos reference][v3]

## Adjust mouse keys and increase tenting

{% v4 + v5 + v6 %}

![It's starting to look like an actual keyboard.
With color coded keycaps; red for mouse-only buttons and violet for the home-row keys.](/images/cosmos/v6_proto.jpg)

Pressing `p` with my ring finger feels great.
Pressing the thumb normal thumb key feels awful because the mouse thumb keys are in the way when I relax my hand.

Adjustments made:

- Moved mouse thumb keys to be more vertical and pressed from the side.
- Added an extra pinky key reachable when I'm using the trackball.
- Increased tenting to 20 degrees from 10 degrees.

![20 degrees of tenting.](/images/cosmos/v6_config.png)

## Wrist rests

![Some of the different wrist rests I tried.
They look a bit weird laid out like this and the weird color correction my phone has going on doesn't help.](/images/cosmos/multiple_wrist_rests.jpg)

::: important
While they're called a _wrist_ rests, I don't think you should hold your arms so that there's pressure on the wrist as that can easily lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.
Surprisingly this is even worse with a softer support but I don't want to risk it either way.

I think of them more as _palm_ rests, where I rest the lower part of the palm on the rest, making sure the wrist itself doesn't receive any pressure.
:::

## Rounded base and pinky tweak

![Yet another prototype.](/images/cosmos/v8_proto.jpg)

- I tried the "rounded" sides and top feature of [Cosmos][] .
- The mouse pinky key was too low, I raised it up a bunch.

## Thumb keys adjustments

![](/images/cosmos/v9_proto.jpg)

- Removed the "rounded" features
- Rotated the main thumb key inwards
- Lowered the must thumb keys a little
- Added an area for a display

## More tweaks

- Removed the display
- Move pinky keys a little upwards
- Move all thumb keys a little further away

![](/images/cosmos/v11_proto.jpg)

## Beta V3

- Configure both halves at once
- Can go between the Advanced and Expert tabs! WOW!

- Tenting angle 15
- Lowered ring pinky column key a little

![](/images/cosmos/v12_proto.jpg)

## Small tweaks to pinky and thumb keys

- Raise/tilt top pinky row key
- Move thumb keys on left side closer together

![](/images/cosmos/v13_proto.jpg)
