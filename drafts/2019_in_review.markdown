2019 Non-Geek Achievements
==========================

1. Played around with Isidor.

   It's hard to describe how happy a kid can make you.

2. Read a bunch of books.

   I like the idea of tracking all the books I read. But I hate the actual tracking part, so I don't actually know what books I did read. [The Big Short][big-short], [Permanent Record][permanent-record] and [A Little Hatred][hatred] are some I read recently, and they're great.

3. Regular grappling training.

   Since we moved, I've only been training grappling very rarely. But now I train Submission Wrestling here once a week.

4. Built a small home gym.

   It's a real luxury.

2019 Geek Achievements
======================

1. Started [writing a book][cryptobook].

   So far I've written around 80% of the planned chapters, so I guess there's only around 80% of the work left. I've managed to produce a bunch of words:

    ```
    > wc -c *.html.pm | sort -n
    402050 total
    ```

   (It's an overestimation, but it gives a rough estimate.)

2. Did some memory training.

   I had a goal of becoming better at memorizing things. Like a deck of cards or better at learning a new language. I haven't done a lot, but it clearly works (although the training is very mentally draining).

3. Wrote a [QR code generation in Rust][qrcode].
3. Wrote some Racket.

4. Assembled my [Ergodox Infinity][ergodox].

5. Built a bunch of Lego.

2019 Failures
==============

1. I wanted to have come further with the memory training.

Plans for 2020
===============

1. Adjust to a new family member, expected in February.
1. Complete enough of the memory training to start learning a new language.
2. Go through the book [building git][building-git].
3. Read some books.

   ![Books I didn't read in 2019 that I want to read in 2020.](/images/IMG_20191225_114508_2.jpg)

   And then some books I want to re-read:

   1. A Song of Ice and Fire series

      *Assuming* the new Game of Thrones book gets released in 2020...

   2. The books in the First Law World

      I regret I didn't re-read the books before I read A Little Hatred, which is the first book in the new trilogy in the world. The other books are to be released in November 2020 and 2021, and Joe Abecrombie did a good job by writing the story of the whole trilogy before even realising the first book.

   3. Dune

      I should prepare for the movie that's coming in 2020 by re-reading the classic book, which I don't really remember other than it being very good.

   This is a whole lot of books for me, as I don't usually read that much. Maybe I need to stop reading so much manga, or lower my expectations a bit. I should be happy if I go through even a third of this list.
