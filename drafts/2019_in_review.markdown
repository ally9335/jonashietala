2019 Non-Geek Achievements
==========================

1. Played around with Isidor.

   It's hard to describe how happy a kid can make you.

2. Read a bunch of books.

   I like the idea of tracking all the books I read. But I hate the actual tracking part, so I don't actually know what books I did read. [The Big Short][big-short], [Permanent Record][permanent-record] and [A Little Hatred][hatred] are some I read recently, and they're great.

3. Regular grappling training.

   Since we moved, I've only been training grappling very rarely. But now I train Submission Wrestling here once a week.

4. Built a small home gym.

   It's a real luxury.

2019 Geek Achievements
======================

1. Started [writing a book][cryptobook].

   So far I've written around 80% of the planned chapters, so I guess there's only around 80% of the work left. I've managed to produce a bunch of words:

    ```
    > wc -c *.html.pm | sort -n
    402050 total
    ```

   (It's an overestimation, but it gives a rough estimate.)

2. Did some memory training.

   I had a goal of becoming better at memorizing things. Like a deck of cards or better at learning a new language. I haven't done a lot, but it clearly works (although the training is very mentally draining).

3. Wrote a [QR code generation in Rust][qrcode].
3. Wrote some Racket.

4. Assembled my [Ergodox Infinity][ergodox].

5. Built a bunch of Lego.

2019 Failures
==============

1. I wanted to have come further with the memory training.

Plans for 2020
===============

1. Adjust to a new family member, expected in February.
1. Complete enough of the memory training to start learning a new language.
2. Go through the book [building git][building-git].
3. Read more books.

   I've got a few on my to-read list, here are some:

   1. Dune (in preparation for the movie)
   2. Re-read the Game of Thrones books (*assuming* a new book is released...)
   3. Fire & Blood
   3. Re-read the books in the First Law world (new book coming in September)
   4. Man's search for meaning
   5. Extreme ownership
   6. The Box
   7. Metro 2034 & Metro 2035

   It's a success if I get through even a third of them. (I mostly read manga/manwha and light novels.)
