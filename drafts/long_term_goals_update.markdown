It's great to have a long term vision of what you want to do, things possibly years in the future or things you wish you'd have done sometime. So I decided to revisited my [long term][prev1] [goals][prev2].

The focus is on precise measurable goals as opposed to fuzzy ones such as "be happy" or "be healthy". I find it easier to have concrete goals which you can almost touch or have a simple way of categorizing as completed.

These are the existing ones:

+ **Contribute to a popular open-source project** *(Completed)*  
    I made a bunch of contributions to [rust][] last year. Hopefully there's more to come when I get some more free time!
+ **Write my own Programming Language** *(Abandoned)*  
    It would be cool to write my own programming language, but in the grand scheme of things this doesn't feel as important.
+ **Own a Snooker table** *(Abandoned)*  
    This isn't quite as important as before.
+ **I want to have kids** *(No change)*  
    Still the most important long-term goal.
+ **Write a Book** *(No change)*  
    For some reason I still think it would be nice to have written a book. I'm keeping this.
+ **Black belt in Taekwon-do** *(Getting closer)*  
    I'm currently at 2-kup, hopefully there in about 14 months?

Here's a couple new ones:

+ **Learn a new language**  
    And I don't mean another programming language, maybe Korean or Finnish.
