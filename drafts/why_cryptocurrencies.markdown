# Intro

Whenever cryptocurrencies, where Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most known, come up in conversations the focus is always on one question:

> What's the value of cryptocurrencies?

> I have a question for you - ELI5 the inherent value in cryptocurrencies.

> Why cryptocurrencies?

It's often followed by excluding illicit purposes

> It is not a better currency in any reasonable way besides illicit uses.

This is an answer to these questions by listing examples where cryptocurrency use makes sense and have benefits compared to other options.

Note that there are several cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most known. We will not focus on any one in particular rather on the promise of cryptocurrencies in general.


# Properties

## Propeties of Money

<http://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/>

### Medium of Exchange

* **Definition**: Can be used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services.
* **Use**: A common ground for determining value.
* **Example**: A community uses beaver pelts as a medium to trade for other goods.

### Unit of Account

* **Definition**: A standard numerical unit of measurement of market value for goods, services, and other transactions.
* **Use**: Can be used to compare goods using a common system.
* **Example**: Housing prices in Japan can be compared using the yen as a unit of account.

### Store of Value

* **Definition**: Maintains its value over time.
* **Use**: Can be spent or exchanged at a later date without penalty.
* **Example**: An ounce of gold could buy a toga in Roman times, yet it can still buy a nice suit today.

In other words:

1. **Divisible**: Can be divided into smaller units of value.
1. **Fungible**: One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
1. **Portable**: Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
1. **Durable**: An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
1. **Acceptable**: Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
1. **Uniform**: All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing power.
1. **Limited in Supply**: The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain relatively constant.

## Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash

What makes a cryptocurrency unique compared to other digital money is it's completely peer-to-peer:

* **Trustless**:  
  We can transfer coins to one another without trusting anyone else.  
  For example if I send you cash with a bank transfer we need to trust the bank.
* **Permissionless**:  
  We can transfer coins to one another without permission from anyone else.  
  For example if I want to send you cash with a bank transfer I need the bank's permission.

In combination with fulfilling the properties of money this makes cryptocurrencies digital cash, or as Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi titled Bitcoin's whitepaper: Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash.

# Better currency

* Move money across borders
* Control of your own money
* Send money to/from inaccessible countries (either Western Union/banks don't support it or are very expensive)
* Protection against inflation in Venezuela

# Better digital payments

* Donations to for example Wikileaks who got their PayPal account frozen (tons of documented cases where PayPal freezes accounts without a good cause)
* Gray area businesses (mariuana, porn, escort services, gambling) that have trouble getting banks/cards
* Avoid credit card charge back fraud
* Lower fees
* A means for unbanked people to do business digitally. Yes there are many of those and you can imagine the difficulties for them if you cannot get a bank account or a credit card in today's society.

## Dark markets.

# Other use

##  New asset class

<https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/02/bitcoin-correlation-assets-diversify/>


<https://midlifecroesus.com/2018/01/bitcoin-non-correlated-asset/>

Bitcoin is not strongly affected by normal macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, taxes, economic or trade policy. As such, it is possible that the correlation value of Bitcoin to equities is closer to 0 than -100.

Indeed, this is the opinion of the founders of Ark Invest. Their whitepaper “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class” describes the nuances of different asset classes, such as stocks, gold, real estate, commodities against the performance of Bitcoin.

If so, the lack of correlation could make an investment in Bitcoin, and possibly other cryptocurrencies,  an attractive alternative asset class to consider in a diversified portfolio that could weather a storm and experience growth, long term.

Cryptocurrencies have weak relationships with established asset classes, which can be good or bad depending on what role you want them to play in your portfolio. This could change if more institutional investors such as banks and hedge funds start buying digital tokens, but for now cryptocurrencies mostly just move in line with each other.

## Provably fair gambling/betting

* Odds for fixed games can be public and verifiable after the fact  
  For example you can verify that a lottery is fair and they're not cheating
* Bets can be stored in advance and used as proof

## Decentralized voting

1. Give out unique keys to all voters, can be done with the same identification as today
2. Each voter uses their key to register their vote on the blockchain

Some nice properties:

* Each voter can be anonymous
* Each voter can verify their vote is registered correctly
* Exact and publicly verifiable vote counting
* No need to trust manual counting of votes
* Reduces trust in voting machines since votes can independently be verified

## Uncensorable twitter

## Tokens

<https://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/>

currency = 7.6 Trillion

derivatives = 544 Trillion


* A token that is issued once by a game developer, but then was set loose in said game as competitive rewards. More tokens give you better gear, and is "enforced" only by common game clients instead of by a central server.
* A discount token issue by a bazaar co-operative periodically. Individual vendors in the bazaar can honor tokens without consulting a central authority.
* A country wishing to issue an entire fiat system, implemented as bearer instruments (instead of permissioned system), on the chain.

There are many cases where the redemption of value and trading is not tied to the same central party as the issuer, I just listed a fraction of them. Not saying whether these usecases are good or bad for BCH - they might ultimately not bring much value to BCH the coin - but I think they are legit usecases that should be considered.

* You could use a token to represent private money (like Canadian Tire dollars)  
  Just need to clarify this: Canadian Tire dollars are more like reward points. You get a few cents for each dollar you spend in the store, and they're redeemable in the store for your next purchase. But they take the form of banknotes, so are anonymous and exchangeable unlike most modern reward systems.
* gift-card style money
* prepaid things like tickets or reservations
* and probably many other things not involving shares or dividends.

There's so many redeemable things in this world with no need for approval when they pass hands.


THERE IS A BIG FUCKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STOCK CERTIFICATES AND THE ABILITY TO TRADE STOCKS TODAY.

With a stock certificate, i can theoretically get it but it is burdensome and hard to transfer. We use trusted third parties with their trusted, centralized markets that charge fees and put restrictions on trade to exchange and transfer contractual rights to stock certificates that are ultimately held by some other trusted third party that extracts value.

With tokenization, we tokenize the stock certificates that give people a native digital (instead of paper) version that they hold, own, send, and can trade themselves without the rent seeking, centralized shit show that you have today.

THAT IS THE FUCKING BENEFIT FOR TOKENS
