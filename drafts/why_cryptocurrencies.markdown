# Intro

Whenever cryptocurrencies, where Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most known, come up in conversations the focus is always on one question:

> What's the value of cryptocurrencies?

> I have a question for you - ELI5 the inherent value in cryptocurrencies.

> Why cryptocurrencies?

It's often followed by excluding illicit purposes

> It is not a better currency in any reasonable way besides illicit uses.

This is an answer to these questions by listing examples where cryptocurrency use makes sense and have benefits compared to other options.

Note that there are several cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most known. We will not focus on any one in particular rather on the promise of cryptocurrencies in general.


# Properties

## Propeties of Money

<http://money.visualcapitalist.com/infographic-the-properties-of-money/>

### Medium of Exchange

* **Definition**: Can be used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services.
* **Use**: A common ground for determining value.
* **Example**: A community uses beaver pelts as a medium to trade for other goods.

### Unit of Account

* **Definition**: A standard numerical unit of measurement of market value for goods, services, and other transactions.
* **Use**: Can be used to compare goods using a common system.
* **Example**: Housing prices in Japan can be compared using the yen as a unit of account.

### Store of Value

* **Definition**: Maintains its value over time.
* **Use**: Can be spent or exchanged at a later date without penalty.
* **Example**: An ounce of gold could buy a toga in Roman times, yet it can still buy a nice suit today.

In other words:

1. **Divisible**: Can be divided into smaller units of value.
1. **Fungible**: One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
1. **Portable**: Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
1. **Durable**: An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
1. **Acceptable**: Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
1. **Uniform**: All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing power.
1. **Limited in Supply**: The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain relatively constant.

## Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash

What makes a cryptocurrency unique compared to other digital money is it's completely peer-to-peer:

* **Trustless**:  
  We can transfer coins to one another without trusting anyone else.  
  For example if I send you cash with a bank transfer we need to trust the bank.
* **Permissionless**:  
  We can transfer coins to one another without permission from anyone else.  
  For example if I want to send you cash with a bank transfer I need the bank's permission.

In combination with fulfilling the properties of money this makes cryptocurrencies digital cash, or as Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi titled Bitcoin's whitepaper: Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash.

# Better currency

* Move money across borders
* Control of your own money
* Send money to/from inaccessible countries (either Western Union/banks don't support it or are very expensive)
* Protection against inflation in Venezuela
* India voids 500 and 1000 rupee bills

## Protection against hyperinflation in Venezuela

Store of value
No central government in control of your money which can suddenly destroy your savings.

## India voids 500 and 1000 rupee bills

Control of your own money.


# Better digital payments

* Donations to for example Wikileaks who got their PayPal account frozen (tons of documented cases where PayPal freezes accounts without a good cause)
* Gray area businesses (marijuana, porn, escort services, gambling) that have trouble getting banks/cards
* Avoid credit card charge back fraud
* Lower fees
* A means for unbanked people to do business digitally. Yes there are many of those and you can imagine the difficulties for them if you cannot get a bank account or a credit card in today's society.

## Donations to WikiLeaks

PayPal froze donations to WikiLeaks: <https://wikileaks.org/PayPal-freezes-WikiLeaks-donations.html>

There are many other examples where PayPal freezes accounts of legitimate businesses suddenly and without good cause. This is quite serious since they also freeze the funds in the account.


## Payments to gray area businesses

Credit card companies don't have any obligation to serve all customers. Instead they can, at their own discretion, choose which customers they want to serve. This means they can deny perfectly legal businesses the ability to get paid by card.

For example Marijuana businesses have [trouble with credit card processing restrictions](https://www.cardfellow.com/blog/credit-card-processing-for-marijuana-businesses/) and have to resort to cash payments despite operating legally. Other examples include porn, escort services and gambling.

With cryptocurrencies these businesses avoids the issue of someone arbitrarily deciding their business shouldn't be able to accept payments digitally.


## Banking the unbanked

A means for unbanked people to do business digitally. Yes there are many of those and you can imagine the difficulties for them if you cannot get a bank account or a credit card in today's society.


Around 2 billion people are unbanked.

Around 15% of the cited people claimed the couldn't get an account:

<https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-unbanked-population-in-6-charts-2017-8?r=UK&IR=T#finally-the-most-common-reason-people-cited-for-not-having-a-bank-account-was-they-did-not-have-enough-money-with-only-4-of-people-saying-the-only-reason-they-didnt-have-one-was-because-they-didnt-need-one-6>

Also that the mobile money market is expanding in particular in developing countries.


This is a perfect use for cryptocurrencies since anyone can easily create a wallet and send/receive coins without any identification or papers of any kind. All that's necessary is an internet connection.


## Safer and cheaper for merchants

Safer: Avoid charge back fraud


Cheaper:

BCH:                $0.003

Fees are depending on the business and amount
VISA/mastercard:    1-3%
PayPal:             2-5%
Western Union:      Varies a lot but typically much more expensive than the other options

[MasterCard explains interchange fees](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/about-mastercard/what-we-do/interchange.html):

> Interchange is a small fee paid by a merchant's bank (acquirer) to a cardholder's bank (issuer) to compensate the issuer for the value and benefits that merchants receive when they accept electronic payments. It enables banks that issue electronic payments to deliver tremendous value to merchants, governments and consumers.

In particular:

> Merchants benefit from guaranteed payment; increased sales; fraud protection; lower processing costs than those associated with other forms of payment such as checks and cash; and the ability to attract and retain customers with a fast, efficient buying experience.



<https://www.cardfellow.com/blog/credit-card-processing-fees/>

Credit card processing fees are quite complex.

> Credit card processing fees are either flat fees, transaction fees, or based on volume. Assessments are listed above, and interchange fees (or at least a portion of them) are published by Visa and MasterCard. The only inconsistent portion of cost is the processor’s markup. Unfortunately, the scope of different fees and pricing models utilized in the marketplace makes accurately comparing markups a daunting task.

## Black markets

There's a concept one should have in mind when talking about black markets:

> Legality doesn't imply morality

For example slavery used to be legal but most would agree it's immoral. Conversely a homeless boy stealing food to prevent his little sister from starving may be illegal but also moral.

Therefore black market usage isn't easily dismissed with "it's illegal" and we should look a little closer at some examples.

But first what is a black market? In short it's a term for a market where transactions are illegal in some way. Obviously buying illegal things or services but it also includes tax violations and transactions outside government control.

This includes paying a craftsman off the books, something that doesn't bother a lot of people.  Or if you've accidentally made any mistakes with taxes on a transaction (happens quite often although without repercussions). 

Also in countries with a lot of corruption or dysfunctional governments black markets are huge. For example in the Soviet Union many people relied on black markets to get their food supply when the market economy failed them. Or in Greece during their economic breakdown where the black market was [estimated at 20 to 25 percent of the GDP](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/greece-bailout-black-market.html):

> The heart of the matter for an ever-rising number of citizens and businesses is that they simply do not have the financial resources anymore to meet their rising tax obligations

Black markets have typically preferred physical cash because it's permissionless nature. With cryptocurrencies there's now a digital equivalent.  An additional to a digital variant is it's easier to store and move especially in larger amounts.

In particular cryptocurrencies enable dark net markets where you can buy and sell stuff online. Contrary to popular belief these too operate with their own morality where they're mostly about subsets of drugs and medicine.

To see the positive side of dark net markets consider this example and try to see yourself in it:

> Your wife got diagnosed with cancer. Despite having insurance it only covers a part of the extremely high medical costs in the US and you're looking at a yearly expense of $20,000 just for the medicine she needs. This is just too much for you to afford but she needs the medicine otherwise she'll die.

What if I told you the same medicine could be bought in India for a fraction of the cost? What if there was a way to easily order it online? Even if it was illegal would you do it? What if the risk of getting caught was very small? There are variations of the same story, [here's one with a bit more detail](https://darkwebnews.com/news/high-costs-force-patients-to-dark-net-in-search-of-needed-medicine/).

This is exactly what cryptocurrencies and dark net markets gives you.

# Other use

##  New asset class

<https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/02/bitcoin-correlation-assets-diversify/>


<https://midlifecroesus.com/2018/01/bitcoin-non-correlated-asset/>

Bitcoin is not strongly affected by normal macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, taxes, economic or trade policy. As such, it is possible that the correlation value of Bitcoin to equities is closer to 0 than -100.

Indeed, this is the opinion of the founders of Ark Invest. Their whitepaper “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class” describes the nuances of different asset classes, such as stocks, gold, real estate, commodities against the performance of Bitcoin.

If so, the lack of correlation could make an investment in Bitcoin, and possibly other cryptocurrencies,  an attractive alternative asset class to consider in a diversified portfolio that could weather a storm and experience growth, long term.

<https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/Bitcoin-Ringing-The-Bell-For-A-New-Asset-Class.pdf>


Cryptocurrencies have weak relationships with established asset classes, which can be good or bad depending on what role you want them to play in your portfolio. This could change if more institutional investors such as banks and hedge funds start buying digital tokens, but for now cryptocurrencies mostly just move in line with each other.

## Provably fair gambling/betting

* Odds for fixed games can be public and verifiable after the fact  
  For example you can verify that a lottery is fair and they're not cheating
* Bets can be stored in advance and used as proof

## Decentralized voting

1. Give out unique keys to all voters, can be done with the same identification as today
2. Each voter uses their key to register their vote on the blockchain

Some nice properties:

* Each voter can be anonymous
* Each voter can verify their vote is registered correctly
* Exact and publicly verifiable vote counting
* No need to trust manual counting of votes
* Reduces trust in voting machines since votes can independently be verified

## Tokens

<https://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/>

currency = 7.6 Trillion

derivatives = 544 Trillion


* A token that is issued once by a game developer, but then was set loose in said game as competitive rewards. More tokens give you better gear, and is "enforced" only by common game clients instead of by a central server.
* A discount token issue by a bazaar co-operative periodically. Individual vendors in the bazaar can honor tokens without consulting a central authority.
* A country wishing to issue an entire fiat system, implemented as bearer instruments (instead of permissioned system), on the chain.

There are many cases where the redemption of value and trading is not tied to the same central party as the issuer, I just listed a fraction of them. Not saying whether these usecases are good or bad for BCH - they might ultimately not bring much value to BCH the coin - but I think they are legit usecases that should be considered.

* You could use a token to represent private money (like Canadian Tire dollars)  
  Just need to clarify this: Canadian Tire dollars are more like reward points. You get a few cents for each dollar you spend in the store, and they're redeemable in the store for your next purchase. But they take the form of banknotes, so are anonymous and exchangeable unlike most modern reward systems.
* gift-card style money
* prepaid things like tickets or reservations
* and probably many other things not involving shares or dividends.

There's so many redeemable things in this world with no need for approval when they pass hands.


THERE IS A BIG FUCKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STOCK CERTIFICATES AND THE ABILITY TO TRADE STOCKS TODAY.

With a stock certificate, i can theoretically get it but it is burdensome and hard to transfer. We use trusted third parties with their trusted, centralized markets that charge fees and put restrictions on trade to exchange and transfer contractual rights to stock certificates that are ultimately held by some other trusted third party that extracts value.

With tokenization, we tokenize the stock certificates that give people a native digital (instead of paper) version that they hold, own, send, and can trade themselves without the rent seeking, centralized shit show that you have today.

THAT IS THE FUCKING BENEFIT FOR TOKENS
