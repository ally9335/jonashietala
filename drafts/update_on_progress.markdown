After far too long, here's a short progress update on the e-book of [Why Cryptocurrencies?][book], a book that explaints what cryptocurrencies are, what they do and why they matter.

The short version is that last year I got severely burnt out and depressed.
If you want the longer version [I wrote about it here][post], but the gist is that I'm just now recovering after over a year of big problems.

This, in combination with us getting our third kid (they're all young and demanding), is the reason that I haven't made any progress even though the e-book was nearly finished over a year ago (yikes).

It's something that will change this year. The PDF + EPUB is already pretty much done, and the next step is to make it purchasable with crypto and fiat from the site.

I plan to accept crypto payments using [BitPal][], a self-hosted payment processor that I started developing.
Unfortunately I underestimated the work necessary, and there was quite a bit of scope-creep (multiple users, stores, a plugin system for backends, a nice user interface not to mention the all-important documentation) that the project got delayed and then completely stalled during my burnout.

So the next step is to update the payment processor, and then add it to the site so I can get the book distributed. It does mean that there will be some more delays, but my goal is to have it finished this summer (fingers crossed).

In the meantime you can [read the finished book online][online] or [buy the printed version][print].
