# Requested funding

## Hosting

$70/month for 6 months = $420

if 1 BCH = $400 => 1.05 BCH (Round up to 1.5 or 2.0?)

## Work hours

### Jonas

approx time I want to spend
8 weeks Mar/Apr = 80 hours
8 weeks May/June = 160 hours
(some work during summer too, depending on when the Flipstarter ends)

= 240 hours total
~= 6 40h weeks

Verde: 480 BCH, 1,600 hours 0.3 BCH/hour

$400 * 0.3 BCH = $120.0/hour ~= 1000 SEK/hour

240,000 SEK

=> 72.0 BCH

### Filip

# What if it isn't successful?
