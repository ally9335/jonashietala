# Display mount

The display mounts I got from the print-it-forward service wasn't compatible with the screen I got.
Now I have a mount that doesn't require tape to hold it together:

# LED mounts

There were no instructions on how to install the LEDs, so I taped them on top of the included extrusions covers.
Turns out you were supposed to print a bunch of LED mounts to get the LEDs pointing inwards towards the print for better lighting:

# Spool holder


Issue: too short for some spools.

Possible solutions:

- https://mods.vorondesign.com/detail/wWS3pc510oGqxGo0awsFKA just longer
- https://mods.vorondesign.com/detail/VjlccbeeOuH5iax4AFHA top, but needs more things
- https://mods.vorondesign.com/detail/x2umK6ZcG6l2c5EEM2LQjQ can mount horizontally

# Handles

I had to have these spacers to mount the handles included in the kit:

The kit came with some very sturdy handles, but unfortunately they install over the top panel so you can't remove the panel without removing the handles.
This clashes badly with my plan to make a more easily removable top panel, but fortunately I found 3D printed handles that work.
