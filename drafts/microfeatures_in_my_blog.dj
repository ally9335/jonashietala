![[xkcd: Nerd sniping][snipe]](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png)

A while I ago I encountered a blog post called [Microfeatures I Love in Blogs and Personal Websites][] and with the related [Hacker News discussion][] I naturally got [nerd sniped][snipe].

:table-of-content:

# Microfeatures are fun

# Microfeatures I've implemented

## Published and revision info

There's a trend for blog posts to not include the date the post was published---and I hate it, _especially_ for technical content.
I don't even like to call the date of publishing a "micro" feature as it more an essential feature.

Regardless, I include the published date below the post title in my blog:

![The published date together with the Git commit.](/images/microfeatures/with_published_date.png)

I also think it's valuable to display the date the post was updated:

![The date of the last revision together with the corresponding Git commit.](/images/microfeatures/with_rev_date.png)

I guess it would be more precise to manually specify when the post was updated, to avoid changes like [Enclose titles in ", now an error after Hakyll update][011cebb16131566a186b1fe7c8ba884890a688d6] where the post content isn't changed in a meaningful way.
It's too bothersome to remember though so I rely on the Git history and have a list of commits I ignore when I fetch the dates.
Not perfect but good enough I think.

## Quote attribution

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
> ^ Socrates

Blockquotes are standard everywhere but you often want to show where the quote originates from.
I use a specific syntax for this:

```djot
> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
> ^ Socrates
```

## Different kinds of notes

I'm a fan of sidenotes and [I used them][tufte] heavily [in the book I wrote][whycypto].
They're great for a certain style of content but for the blog I noticed I used them very rarely.
Instead I use "notes" of different kinds to highlight certain things:

::: note
This is a regular note.
:::

{date="2002-01-12"}
::: update
If I want to make a correction I can add a note with a timestamp.
:::

::: tip
Did you know that you can [check out the source][src] of this site to see how the features are implemented?
:::

::: warn
It's easy to spend a lot of time building features for the blog instead of actually writing.
:::

::: important
Building features just for the sake of building is perfectly fine!
:::

Maybe a weird thing to prioritize in a post but I really like the additional color splash the notes can give to a post.

I also have footnotes[^footnote] (mostly because [Djot][] provides them by default) but I never really use them.
I guess I should use footnotes more now that I have them.

[^footnote]: xxx

## Display the language or path for code blocks

For code blocks I add a small description that displays the language.
It can be customized to for example display the path of the file:

![](/images/microfeatures/code_descr.png)

Displaying code is an area where I could do more, for example:

- Optionally display line numbers (with offsets).
- Highlight lines.
- Highlight words or diff against the previous code block.
- Links to the complete source code.

## Syntax highlight for inline code elements

Highlighting code blocks is standard but I wonder, why don't we also highlight inline code?

It's something I added to be able to refer back to values like `"-NoHU"`lua, `0`lua, and `require("telescope.builtin").find_files()`lua when explaining what happens inside a code block.
A sentence with color is much more pleasing than the colorless `"-NoHU"`, `0`,and `require("telescope.builtin").find_files()` don't you think?

## Flex and gallery display for images

## Different list types

I like lists and I have several different types I can use to mix things up a bit.

Here are some ordered list types:

1. One
1. Two

a. Alpha 1
a. Alpha 2

i. Roman 1
i. Roman 2

::: greek
a. Alpha
a. Beta
:::

And here are some unordered list types:

- Bullet

::: list-dash
- Dash
:::

::: list-plus
- Plus
:::

Necessary? No.\
Fun? I think so.

## Highlight projects

- Highlighted projects on the homepage

## Series

## Heading links

## Featured posts on the homepage

## "Archive" contains index of all posts

- Also a "per year" index of all posts

## Featured & favorite posts

Highlighting favorite posts is a good idea I got from the [Hacker News discussion][] and one I just had to implement after seeing it.
I handle featured and favorite posts in three ways:

1. I list five featured posts on the homepage:

   ![Featured posts on the homepage.](/images/microfeatures/featured_posts.png)

   ::: note
   A featured post isn't the same as a favorite post, although the featured posts tend to be favorites.
   :::

1. All favorite posts are listed under [/favorite](/favorite).

1. Each favorite post is accompanied by a star: `<span class="favorite"><a href="/favorite">â˜…</a></span>`{=html}

   ![A post listing from the [archives](/archive).](/images/microfeatures/archive_favs.png)

   Clicking on the star takes you to [/favorite](/favorite).


## Table of content

I can optionally insert a table of contents by including a `:table-of-content:` marker in the markup.
It uses the [<details>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element and is collapsed by default.
When expanded it looks like this:

![Expanded table of content.](/images/microfeatures/toc.png)

It's important for me that the table of content is optional as I have a mix of small and large posts.
The table of content is generated from the first two heading levels and it works quite well for my use-case.
