![[xkcd: Nerd sniping][snipe]](/images/microfeatures/nerd_sniping.png)

A while I ago I encountered a blog post called [Microfeatures I Love in Blogs and Personal Websites][] and with the related [Hacker News discussion][] I naturally got [nerd sniped][snipe].

:table-of-content:

# Microfeatures are fun and time consuming

For some people, blogging is their job.
For me, blogging is a way to delve deeper into ideas, to document my journey to future me, to relax, or have fun.
Microfeatures are _fun_ and so they're a perfect fit for my blog.

I also really appreciate microfeatures in other blogs.
It's nice to [discover a beautiful table of content](https://www.evalapply.org/posts/n-ways-to-fizzbuzz-in-clojure/index.html) or a [page with favorite blog posts](https://jvns.ca/categories/favorite/).
It makes me want to stick around longer and appreciate the craft that is blogging.

But realize that microfeatures take time to implement.
One small feature won't make a big difference but dozens of microfeatures might transform your blog rewrite you thought were going to take a weekend, to a project spanning weeks or even months.

# Microfeatures I've implemented

Here's a list of notable microfeatures I've made for the blog.
It's not an exhaustive list, just the ones I think are fun, interesting, or that I'd like to see in more blogs.

## Published and revision info

There's a trend for blog posts to not include the date the post was published---and I hate it, _especially_ for technical content.
I don't even like to call the date of publishing a "micro" feature as it more an essential feature.

Regardless, I include the published date below the post title in my blog:

![The published date together with the Git commit.](/images/microfeatures/with_published_date.png)

I also think it's valuable to display the date the post was updated:

![The date of the last revision together with the corresponding Git commit.](/images/microfeatures/with_rev_date.png)

I guess it would be more precise to manually specify when the post was updated, to avoid changes like [Enclose titles in ", now an error after Hakyll update][011cebb16131566a186b1fe7c8ba884890a688d6] where the post content isn't changed in a meaningful way.
It's too bothersome to remember though so I rely on the Git history and have a list of commits I ignore when I fetch the dates.
Not perfect but good enough I think.

## Quote attribution

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
> ^ Socrates

Blockquotes are standard everywhere but you often want to show where the quote originates from.

I think it's nicer to have specific styling for attributes than to solve it manually, like this:

> The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.\
> --- Socrates

## Different kinds of notes

I'm a fan of sidenotes and [I used them][tufte] heavily [in the book I wrote][whycypto].
They're great for a certain style of content but for the blog I noticed I used them very rarely.
Instead I use "notes" of different kinds to highlight certain things:

::: note
This is a regular note.
:::

{date="2002-01-12"}
::: update
If I want to make a correction I can add a note with a timestamp.
:::

::: tip
Did you know that you can [check out the source][src] of this site to see how the features are implemented?
:::

::: warn
It's easy to spend a lot of time building features for the blog instead of actually writing.
:::

::: important
Building features just for the sake of building is perfectly fine!
:::

Maybe a weird thing to prioritize in a post but I really like the additional color splash the notes can give to a post.

I also have footnotes[^footnote] (mostly because [Djot][] provides them by default) but I never really use them.
I guess I should use footnotes more now that I have them.

[^footnote]: [Djot][] has a bunch of nice benefits over markdown such as footnotes.

             There are various flavors such as [Pandoc][] flavored markdown that has footnotes, among other things.

## Display the language or path for code blocks

For code blocks I add a small description that displays the language.
It can be customized to for example display the path of the file:

![](/images/microfeatures/code_descr.png)

Displaying code is an area where I could do more, for example:

- Optionally display line numbers (with offsets).
- Highlight lines.
- Highlight words or diff against the previous code block.
- Links to the complete source code.

## Syntax highlight for inline code elements

Highlighting code blocks is standard but I wonder, why don't we also highlight inline code?

It's something I added to be able to refer back to values like `"-NoHU"`lua, `0`lua, and `require("telescope.builtin").find_files()`lua when explaining what happens inside a code block.
A sentence with color is much more pleasing than the colorless `"-NoHU"`, `0`,and `require("telescope.builtin").find_files()` don't you think?

## Table of content

I can optionally insert a table of contents by including a `:table-of-content:` marker in the markup.
It uses the [<details>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) element and is collapsed by default.
When expanded it looks like this:

![Expanded table of content for [Let's create a Tree-sitter grammar](/blog/2024/03/19/lets_create_a_tree-sitter_grammar).](/images/microfeatures/toc.png)

It's important for me that the table of content is optional as I have a mix of small and large posts.
The table of content is generated from the first two heading levels and it works quite well for my use-case.

## Flex and gallery display for images

I sometimes want to display two or more images next to each other.
Instead of having images embedded like normal I place two or more images in a `<figure>`html and use [flexbox][] to place them next to each other:

::: Flex
![](/images/hextraction/fancy_board.jpg)
![](/images/hextraction/modular_board.jpg)

Two boards for a game called [Hextraction][] that I [3D printed](/blog/2024/02/09/printing_hextraction_for_my_kids).
:::

When I have more images I use [CSS grid][] to create a small gallery:

::: Gallery
![](/images/trap14/Robot_0001.jpg)
![](/images/trap14/Robot_0002.jpg)
![](/images/trap14/Robot_0005.jpg)
![](/images/trap14/Robot_0010.JPG)
![](/images/trap14/Robot_0012.JPG)
![](/images/trap14/Robot_0013.JPG)

## Different list types

I like lists and I have several different types I can use to mix things up a bit.

Here are some ordered list types:

1. One
1. Two

a. Alpha 1
a. Alpha 2

i. Roman 1
i. Roman 2

::: greek
a. Alpha
a. Beta
:::

And here are some unordered list types:

- Bullet

::: list-dash
- Dash
:::

::: list-plus
- Plus
:::

Necessary? No.\
Fun? I think so.

## Unbroken indexes of all posts

Under [/archive](/archive) I have a list of all posts so it's easy to scroll through and get an overview of what I've written about during the 15 years the blog has been active.

Naturally there's no pagination so you can just scroll through.
I only have _279_ posts... What's the point of pagination anyway?

There's also indexes for [tags](/blog/tags) (see [keyboards](/blog/tags/keyboards)) and per year (see [2023](/blog/2023)).
The yearly index mostly exists so I have an easy way to see the past years posts when I do my [yearly review](/blog/tags/yearly_review).

## Featured & favorite posts

Highlighting favorite posts is a good idea I got from the [Hacker News discussion][] and one I just had to implement after seeing it.
I handle featured and favorite posts in three ways:

1. I list five featured posts on the homepage:

   ![Featured posts on the homepage.](/images/microfeatures/featured_posts.png)

   ::: note
   A featured post isn't the same as a favorite post, although the featured posts tend to be favorites.
   :::

1. All favorite posts are listed under [/favorite](/favorite).

1. Each favorite post is accompanied by a star: `<span class="favorite"><a href="/favorite">â˜…</a></span>`{=html}

   ![A post listing from the [archives](/archive).](/images/microfeatures/archive_favs.png)

   Clicking on the star takes you to [/favorite](/favorite).

## Series

Tags are fine for grouping slightly related posts but sometimes posts follow a more structured story, which is where [series](/series) come in.

A good example of a series is the [Let's build a VORON Trident](/series/voron_trident) where I document my journey of building my first 3D printer in 12 posts.

There's a few features that come with a series:

1. All series, both ongoing and completed, are listed under [/series](/series).

1. Each series gets a separate page with a description and the list of posts.

   See [/series/voron_trident](/series/voron_trident) or [/series/t-34](/series/t-34).

1. A post is clearly marked as belonging to a series.

   It's marked next to the post title:

   ![The series is marked both above and below the post title.](/images/microfeatures/series_post_title.png)

   And more information about the series is included at the end of the post, so it's easy to jump around in the series:

   ![All posts in the series are included at the end of a post.](/images/microfeatures/series_post_end.png)

1. Selected series are showcased on the homepage.

I like series and I want to write more series.
The drawback is that they take more effort to create than standalone blog posts.
As my attention and motivation tends to shift a lot this increases the [risk of stress][] if I lose motivation in the middle of a series.

## Projects

While a blog is about writing I also wanted to highlight some of the personal projects I've made.

There are no individual pages for the projects as they typically live outside this site (maybe at GitHub).
Instead I have a [/projects](/projects) page with all the projects and I include a filtered version on the homepage.

The projects markup is fairly simple, just a title and a description (that could include an image, code block, or whatever):

![The [T-34 Keyboard layout](/series/t-34/) project.](/images/microfeatures/t34_project.png)

Long ago I made some game prototypes and I wanted to showcase them in a slightly different manner.
They're still included as a project but they get specialized markup that I'm pretty happy with:

![The games overview in the [/projects](/projects) page.](/images/microfeatures/games.png)

## Dark mode

::: flex
![](/images/microfeatures/djot_light.png)
![](/images/microfeatures/djot_dark.png)

The light and dark style of the site.
:::

Because I have a preference for dark mode I really wanted a dark mode for the blog, while also catering to people who prefers a light mode.

[I implemented](/blog/2023/10/04/giving_the_blog_a_facelift/#automatic-dark-mode) dark mode using [prefers-color-scheme][], a simple solution that doesn't require JavaScript and "just works".
It's a CSS feature that allows the user to specify their preference using the browser or operating system.

# Microfeatures I may implement in the future

Naturally, there's always more features you can implement.
Many I won't bother with but there are some that I think are good ideas and that I may implement one day.

## Targeted RSS feeds

RSS feeds are awesome and I think all blogs should have them (and news sites, social media sites... almost everything really).
I do of course [have a feed](/feed.xml) but it might be a good idea to add specialized feeds such as:

- Feed for a series
- Feed for a tag

The only reason I don't have them is lazyness.

## Search

Because it's a static site it's harder to have a good search functionality.
Maybe there's a good way to create/include one but I haven't looked into it more.

## A better 404 page

Perhaps related to the search functiunality, it would be nice if the 404 page would include a helpful "did you mean" message.

For example if you typed in the path `/use` it could suggest you to try [/uses](/uses) instead.

So far I've avoided JavaScript in the blog but here it would be nice to have.
