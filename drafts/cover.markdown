I recently [posted]() the cover for my book [Why Cryptocurrencies?](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/) and asked how many crypto references you could find. The cover was received really well but it was hard to find the references.

Some are pretty obvious but others are very far-fetched, so here's a list with an explanation of the less obvious ones:

1. XXX

   Porn is a great use-case for cryptocurrencies.

1. TXSTREET

   Transactions and [txstreet](https://txstreet.com/).

1. Decentralization blip
1. BANK "trust us"

   With crypto we don't need to.

1. Apache helicopters

   It's a reference to "[Collateral Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is9sxRfU-ik)", which was a video of the U.S. army killing civilians with a helicopter. This was one of the many war crimes that Chelsea Manning leaked, which later lead to the U.S. government forcing PayPal and banks to drop support for WikiLeaks.

   I used this to illustrate the importance of uncensorable donations [in the book](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/uncensorable_donations.html).
1. Casino

   Online gambling is a good use-case for crypto.

1. Bitcoin logo
1. Dogecoin logo
1. Monero logo
1. Ethereum logo
1. "Blockchain"
1. "Bitcoin Money Movers"
1. "Money Union"

   A play on "Western Union" and that crypto is good for remittance.
1. A church cross

   A reference to how crypto might [separate money from state](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/separation_of_money_and_state.html) in a similar way to how church was once separated from state (in some countries).
1. "Store value here"
1. "24/seven"

   A reference to how cryptocurrencies have a very high uptime. According to the [Bitcoin Uptime Tracker](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-uptime/) Bitcoin has an uptime of 99.986%.

1. "Mine co"

   Just a regular old mining shop.

1. "Pay toilet"

   A reference to how in [the cashless dystopia](https://whycryptocurrencies.com/cashless_dystopia.html) toilets will only be usable with credit cards, forcing the unbanked to shit on the street. In Sweden there are already public toilets that work this way.

1. Marijuana logo + "Monero"
1. "+" sign

   Via darknet markets you might be able to buy medical supply to reasonable prices, which can be [extremely expensive](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/most-expensive-prescription-drugs/index.html) in certain countries (USA).

1. A barrel of burning dollar bills
1. A Snowden wanted poster (there are several smaller ones too, where his face isn't visible)

   With crypto we might be able to claw back some of our financial privacy.

1. A QR code on the street

   Sadly we couldn't keep it scannable. It should link to: <https://whycryptocurrencies.com/>

1. A mobile phone

   It's how we'll use crypto in the real world most of the time.

1. "No Bills" sign

   It's hard to see as it fades away into the back of the book.

1. A Guy Fawkes mask

   Symbolises freedom and anonymity.

1. A syringe

   Crypto is often used to buy drugs from a darknet market.

1. Warren Buffet rat

   Warren buffet has famously said that Bitcoin is "probably rat poison squared."

   I must admit that this wasn't anything I planned, we included the rat to enhance the dystopian feeling. This was something /u/1UazZNfbWi [remarked](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ldh52o/the_cover_for_my_book_about_cryptocurrencies_is/gm7mcvv/) and it was too good to ignore, so I'm now running with it...

1. We're heading towards a dystopia

   The whole cover is inspired by the cybperpunk dystopia that we're unfortunately moving towards. Privacy is largely abandoned, cash is being outlawed and mega-corps are taking over.

   The ultimate irony would be if the cryptocurrency revolution fails and people would use a digital currency controlled by Facebook. Us cryptocurrency supporters would be a minority, having to do business in the run-down streets hiding from the watchful eyes in the sky.

   (Except for Dogecoin that will play with the big boys of course.)

There were many good ideas I had to leave out. I very much would've liked to include an S/M couple, a money-printer going BRRR and a Lambo but alas...
