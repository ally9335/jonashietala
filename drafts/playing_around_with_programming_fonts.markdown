# Why bother?

# Are good programming fonts objective or subjective?

## Monospace or not?

## Ligatures or not?

# Paid fonts

# Old

* Iosevka
  Bunch of issues with rendering ligatures in Kitty:

  Could not find a good terminal that supports ligatures in linux...
  Can customize a ton of things, see for example:
  https://typeof.net/Iosevka/customizer
* JetBrains Mono
* Triplicate
  Serif, looks pretty good (for a serif!)
* Hack
  No ligatures.
  Funky 0, but I've grown to like it.

Add Fira Code ligatures to any font:

Found one good terminal that supports ligatures (kitty), but it doesn't support Iosevka ligatures. It also has some problems rendering italics/bold that go outside the monospaced box width.
