I can print, but there are still some parts I've had to print myself to complete the mods included in the LDO kit, and I also wanted to add more mods I've found.

It's a wonderful feeling to augment the printer with parts made by the printer itself.

# Nevermore filter

![The Nevermore filter is installed next to the back panel.](/images/trident/nevermore_installed.jpg)

The parts I received from the print-it-forward service didn't have [the plenum mount][nevermore-trident], so I printed the plenum and the frame connector myself using PLA.
I know that PLA isn't ideal, but I'm not comfortable printing with ABS in my office without the Nevermore up and running.

It was cute how LDO included a small board so that you don't have to crimp any cables.](/images/trident/nevermore_solder.jpg)

# HEPA exhaust filter

While I have the Nevermore filter, it doesn't filter Ultra-Fine Particulates.
For that you need a HEPA filter.
Health is good, and as the printer currently sits in my home office finding a good solution was very important for me.

There were a few solutions with combined carbon and HEPA filter, but since I already have the Nevermore I wanted a standalone HEPA filter.
I found the [Voron HEPA Exhaust Filter][] that replaces the stock filter.

# Missing parts for mods included in the kit

With Nevermore and a HEPA exhaust filter I have a setup that I feel is safe enough to print ABS, so I can finally print out the parts I've been missing to complete the build.

## Display mount

The display mounts I got from the print-it-forward service wasn't compatible with the screen I got.
Now I have a mount that doesn't require tape to hold it together:

## Handles

I had to have these spacers to mount the handles included in the kit:

## LED mounts

There were no instructions on how to install the LEDs, so I taped them on top of the included extrusions covers.
Turns out you were supposed to print a bunch of LED mounts to get the LEDs pointing inwards towards the print for better lighting:

The printer is now Officially Doneâ„¢ and here's a video of it in action:

TODO

But a project like this is never *really* done now is it?
I still have plenty of ideas I'd like to explore with the printer, for example:

1. Attach a camera so I can view the print from my phone.

1. Connect a filament runout sensor to pause the printer if filament runs out.

   Shouldn't this be standard?

1. Replace the Clockwork 2 extruder with the [Galileo 2].

   It's new and shiny!

But that's a story for another time.
