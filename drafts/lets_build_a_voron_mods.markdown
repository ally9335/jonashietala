I can print, but there are still some parts I've had to print myself to complete the mods included in the LDO kit, and I also wanted to add more mods I've found.

It's a wonderful feeling to augment the printer with parts made by the printer itself.

# Nevermore filter

![The Nevermore filter is installed next to the back panel.](/images/trident/nevermore_installed.jpg)

The parts I received from the print-it-forward service didn't have [the plenum mount][nevermore-trident], so I printed the plenum and the frame connector myself using PLA.
I know that PLA isn't ideal, but I'm not comfortable printing with ABS in my office without the Nevermore up and running.

![Cutting away parts from the fans was horrible. They broke very easily.](/images/trident/nevermore_fans.jpg)

![I finally got to exercise my (very poor) soldering skills!
It was cute how LDO included a small board so that you don't have to crimp any cables.](/images/trident/nevermore_solder.jpg)

# HEPA exhaust filter

![A new HEPA filter. I wasn't able to color match with the print-it-forward parts...](/images/trident/hepa_filter.jpg)

While I have the Nevermore filter, it doesn't filter Ultra-Fine Particulates.
For that you need a HEPA filter.
Health is good, and as the printer currently sits in my home office finding a good solution was very important for me.

There were a few solutions with combined carbon and HEPA filter, but since I already have the Nevermore I wanted a standalone HEPA filter.
I found the [Voron HEPA Exhaust Filter][] that replaces the stock filter.

# Mods included in the kit

With Nevermore and a HEPA exhaust filter I have a setup that I feel is safe enough to print ABS, so I can finally print out the parts I've been missing to complete the build.

## Display mount

The display mounts I got from the print-it-forward service wasn't compatible with the screen I got.
Now I have a mount that doesn't require tape to hold it together:

## Handles

I had to have these spacers to mount the handles included in the kit:

The kit came with some very sturdy handles, but unfortunately they install over the top panel so you can't remove the panel without removing the handles.
This clashes badly with my plan to make a more easily removable top panel, but fortunately I found 3D printed handles that work.

## LED mounts

There were no instructions on how to install the LEDs, so I taped them on top of the included extrusions covers.
Turns out you were supposed to print a bunch of LED mounts to get the LEDs pointing inwards towards the print for better lighting:

## Purge bucket

The kit comes with a steel brush and references the [Decontaminator Purge Bucket & Nozzle Scrubber][purge] mod that I was quite excited for.

Unfortunately, Tap decreases the range of motion for the toolhead so that the nozzle no longer can reach back behind the bed:

![This is as far back the nozzle can go. As you can see, it doesn't reach the (now unused) z endstop, and there's no room for a purge bucket / nozzle scrubber.](/images/trident/noise_y_reach.jpg)

One solution is to replace printed Tap with a [CNC Tap][] which is thinner than the printed Tap I use, so it doesn't compromise range in the Y-direction.

# RockNRoll

Flipping over the printer to access the electronics apartment is a huge pain.
There's a very cool [inverted electronics bay mod][] for Trident printers, but it's a tall ask for me to redo *all* the wiring at this point.

But then I found the simple [RockNRoll][] mod that allows you to easily tilt the printer.
Just having the rockers doesn't work as the center of gravity is too high for the Trident, but with [these additional stilts][rock-stilts] it works great.

Possible solutions:

- https://mods.vorondesign.com/detail/VjlccbeeOuH5iax4AFHA top, but needs more things
- https://mods.vorondesign.com/detail/x2umK6ZcG6l2c5EEM2LQjQ can mount horizontally

# Galileo 2

Replace the Clockwork 2 extruder with the [Galileo 2].

# I foresee more mods in this printer's future

The printer is now Officially Doneâ„¢ and here's a video of it in action:
