This is my layout for the Gergoplex that I've been tinkering with. It uses a couple of QMK features such as combos, home row mods, one-shot layers and double taps.

For a writeup of *why* things look like they do, see this other post.

## Base layer

Combos are activated by pressing two keys at the same time. Because of switches with low resistance and flat keycaps it's easy to press between the keys.

## Special characters

Pressing the one-shot key `´` and then `e` creates the `é` character.

## Mouse and shortcuts
