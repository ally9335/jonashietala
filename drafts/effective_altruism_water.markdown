Suppose you have some money you wanted to give away, to do good in this world. What would you do with it?

One option would be to give it to a local sports club---maybe to buy some things they sell---or maybe give it away to your kids. Or buy your significant other a gift, or perhaps even buy yourself a gift!

These are arguably good things to do with your money, but if we want to do good we'll probably send it to a charity of some sort. But which one? Maybe you know someone who have cancer---so you'll give it to cancer research. Perhaps building schools or hospitals in Africa? Saving local animals? How do you choose?

For me, when I thought about this, I arrived at a key question:

> How can my money do the most good?

Apparently there's a whole movement around this question, called [Effective altruism][].


# What is "most good"?

There's this phenomena where the closer you are to something, the more important it becomes. It's why we're absolutely outraged when we hear about someone getting raped close to where we live. But when we hear about whole villages getting slaughtered in some remote part of Africa (after raping the women there) we're not nearly as bothered.

Maybe it's because we feel we can't do anything about the situation in Africa---but we might be able to do something in our neighbourhood. Or maybe it's a sense of security: if someone gets raped nearby, maybe I'm next?

In any case I can't help but wonder, do we think the same when thinking about charity? Are lives in Africa worth less than lives here in Sweden (or wherever you live)?

When I think about it this way the answer must be "of course not" (unless we're thinking about family and friends).

Therefore the "most good" should be to save---or improve---as many lives as possible with the money we have. It doesn't matter where or how, the point is cold efficiency.


# What areas do the most good?

To evaluate which area to focus on we can use this [framework]():

* Affects the life of many people, to a great extent
* Few people are working on the problem
* More resources will do a great deal to address it

The [Effective altruism][] wikipedia page lists these three areas:

1. Global poverty alleviation
2. Animal welfare
3. Long term future and global catastrophic risks

The [GiveWell][] charity lists charities in these areas as their top charities (in poor countries of course):

1. Malaria prevention
2. Deworming programs
3. Vitamin supplements
4. Cash distribution

I must admit I haven't looked in depth to all of these, but there is one focus area that lies close to my heart that's missing:

1. Clean water


# Why water?


# How can I help?

Firstly, don't be put off by all of this. Even if you choose to donate in an "inefficient" way, it's still much better than nothing.
