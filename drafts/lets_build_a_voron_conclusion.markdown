It's finally doneâ„¢.
I've built a VORON that prints reliably and I've modded it enough to be able to leave it alone for a while, so I think it's time to wrap up this build series with a little retrospective.

TODO img/video/timelapse here

---


- Video of it printing in real-time (and/or a gif)
- Timelapse of it printing
- Apart from initial calibration, zero issues with first layers
- Even though I've tried to be as detailed as possible, there are still many things I left out:

  - G-code configuration
  - Slicer management
  - Minor issues here and there (stuck filament, wet filament, etc)
- Thought about VORON?
- Thought about the LDO kit?
- Thought about Tap?
- No idea how many hours I've put into it

The printer has X hours already.

# The build

# So many things to learn

# Issues

1. Noisy
1. Not the best for PLA
1. Had to mod in HEPA filter, and still not sure I want to work next to it
