I'm not sure where it came from, but it was suddenly very important that I got myself a 3D printer.
Maybe it was an important insight, but it maybe it was only a fix idea I got that somehow became this all-import thing.

Either way, I now have lots of parts for a [Voron Trident 250][trident] and I figured I'll try to document the journey of building it (or failing to).


# Why a Voron?

The first step to building a 3D printer is deciding on what printer to build.
This was roughly my selection process:

1. An [Ender 3][] seems like a cheap and popular printer, maybe that's a good place to start?
1. Hmm, the quality of an [Ender 3][] doesn't seem that great and the internet says that you'll spend a lot of time to tweak and modify it until you get something good.
1. The [Prusa MK4][] has just released, and their printers have historically been really solid.
1. Prusa seems open-source friendly (well, sort-of) but I'd probably want an enclosure as well...
1. There is a Prusa enclosure, but holy crap it's large and expensive. Maybe there's something else that has a built-in enclosure?
1. Damn, this [Voron][] thing looks amazing and at around the same price range of the Prusa.

And that's how I ended up wanting a [Voron][].

Now, a [Voron][] is a really cool printer and there are lots of things that drew me towards it:

1. It's completely open source.
1. The footprint is small and it comes with an enclosure.
1. You can mod it to your hearts content.
1. You build it from scratch, meaning you'll get the knowledge of how to mod and repair it (I hope).

At this point it didn't matter that I'm a complete 3D printer noob and that a [Voron][] is not recommended for beginners.
I wanted one, and settling for something else would just leave me filled with regrets and I would've just bought a [Voron][] later anyway.
So I bought the printer I wanted directly instead.

I got the 250mm version over the 300 and the 350 simply because it's much easier to fit in my office and in my storage.
I'm not planning to make any larger prints so the larger sizes felt unnecessary to me.

Now as I said a [Voron][] isn't a beginner printer, but I did take some countermeasures to hopefully make the build more manageable for me:

1. Bought the expensive LDO kit as it's as close to a "just build it" kit you can find.
2. Went with the Trident over a 2.4 because the Trident is supposedly a little easier to build.

I also made one choice that probably makes it a little more difficult for myself:

1. Even though the kit comes with the Klicky Mod, I want to use Voron Tap.

   At the moment I'm not planning to install Klicky at all, but we'll see how that goes.

As I don't have a printer I used the [print it forward][pif] service to buy the printed parts for the printer.
