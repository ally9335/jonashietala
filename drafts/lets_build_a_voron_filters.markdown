# Nevermore filter

![The Nevermore filter is installed next to the back panel.](/images/trident/nevermore_installed.jpg)

The parts I received from the print-it-forward service didn't have [the plenum mount][nevermore-trident], so I printed the plenum and the frame connector myself using PLA.
I know that PLA isn't ideal, but I'm not comfortable printing with ABS in my office without the Nevermore up and running.

![Cutting away parts from the fans was horrible. They broke very easily.](/images/trident/nevermore_fans.jpg)

![I finally got to exercise my (very poor) soldering skills!
It was cute how LDO included a small board so that you don't have to crimp any cables.](/images/trident/nevermore_solder.jpg)

# HEPA exhaust filter

![A new HEPA filter. I wasn't able to color match with the print-it-forward parts...](/images/trident/hepa_filter.jpg)

While I have the Nevermore filter, it doesn't filter Ultra-Fine Particulates.
For that you need a HEPA filter.
Health is good, and as the printer currently sits in my home office finding a good solution was very important for me.

There were a few solutions with combined carbon and HEPA filter, but since I already have the Nevermore I wanted a standalone HEPA filter.
I found the [Voron HEPA Exhaust Filter][] that replaces the stock filter.
