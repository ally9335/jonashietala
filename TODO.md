Migrate to pygments syntax highlighter instead
Maybe something like this: https://jip.dev/posts/the-switch-to-hakyll/


* Lexer for Pollen
  Use multiple lexers: https://pygments.org/docs/lexerdevelopment/ by delegating to class pygments.lexers.lisp.RacketLexer
* Add a commit ref when a post was generated?
