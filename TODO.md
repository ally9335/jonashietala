- Broken link detection breaks if they're inside code blocks

- Deploy to S3 via GitHub actions
    Need to verify cargo test first

- T-34 series
    DONE /series/t-34
         /blog/tags/t-34 should include a note to redirect to the series page
    DONE Each post should include a series notice
    DONE Each post should also include a note to redirect to the current t-34 blog post
    DONE /blog/current-t-34  detail all

- Handle create/moves in watch command

- ARIA for accesibility https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA

- Neovim plugin for interactive editing + updating + scrolling
  Like this: https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim

- Styling
    Prev/Next in posts
    Include prog lang in codeblocks

- Markdown parsing things
    - Auto TOC

- Git commit per post

- Prev/Next in monthly archives

- Nice to have but not prio
    - Tests for archive generation
    - Tests for watch functionality

- Unsupported markdown features:
    - `|` inside a table breaks the table! (see t-34)
      We have `<code>\|</code>` workarounds

Things to update:
    - Initial toc looks bad (RTS, reinstalling slackware, game design, ...)

1. Rust rewrite for speed and reproducability
2. Post series
3. Rewrite projects page
4. No drafts in release
