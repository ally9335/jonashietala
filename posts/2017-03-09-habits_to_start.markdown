I haven't been feeling quite as forward or as energetic lately. There are no set plans, habits or goals for this spring and I don't have a clear vision of what to do currently but it also feels... fine? Maybe I will cruise in a lower gear for a while and rev up when my mood changes. In the meanwhile I have habits I'd like to cultivate *sometime*.

# Daily Habits

* Headspace either on mornings or evenings
* Read a book ~15-min before sleep
* Flashcards with Anki for example
* Listen to talk to me in korean podcast
* Cold shower

# Weekly Habits

* Study BJJ videos/instuctionals
* Study korean (workbooks etc)
* Hobby project a little every weekend
