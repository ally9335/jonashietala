This is my postmortem for my [Ludum Dare 33][] entry, [Groar][], with the theme *You are the Monster*. I also made a timelapse using my [hacky timelapse script][tl] which you can find [here][Groar].

# The Good

* Support from my girlfriend
* It was incredibly fun!
* Bounding boxes and collision detection. Time consuming but ended up ok.

# The Bad

* The gameplay was fairly bad, it's easy to beat the game as the AI will just get stuck in the corners.
* No sound.
* Not prepared (yet again).

# The Ugly

* The AI was one of the hardest 
* The art has some sort of charm to it, but ideally the art would be more fleshed out.
