At LIU we use timeedit to track our schedules. Recently they updated their interface and improved some parts. It's now possible to create a prenumeration of a collection of courses exported as `csv` which can then be imported to other calendar apps. But they also started to obfuscate their urls.

This is the schedule for a single course `TGTU49` in the interval "now - 2015-01-17":

<https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/ri157XQQ519Z50Qv27045gZ6y7Y7206Q6Y45Y7.html>

This is for the courses `TGTU49` and `TATA49` in the same interval:

<https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/ri15YXQ2519Z55Qv2X0457Q6y4Y120876Y45Y7gQ6076775Z7.html>

There seem to be some logic behind the urls, but first, let's look at how they handle search.

Using firebug we can intercept the json requests when we click the search button at

<https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/ri1Q7.html>

We find a GET request to

<https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/objects.html?max=15&fr=t&partajax=t&im=f&sid=3&l=sv&search_text=TGTU49&types=219&fe=132.0&fe=115.20132,20141,20142>

which has has some search results formatted as html:

```html
<div id="objectbasketitemX0" data-id="363972.219" data-idonly="363972" data-type="219" data-name="TGTU49, Teknikhistoria, 1, TGTU49 1445-1503 Valla"  class="clickable2 searchObject   " >
  <table id="table0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="infotable infotablenormal">

    <td>
    <div id="info0">
    <div class="infoboxtitle ">
      TGTU49, Teknikhistoria, 1, TGTU49 1445-1503 Valla
    </div>
    <div class="objectfieldsextrawrap">
    <table cellspacing="0" class="objectfieldsextra">
    </table></div>

    </div>
  </td>
  </tr></table>
</div>
```

`types=219` means we're searching for a course and if can change it to `types=205` we can search for student groups instead. If we change `objects.html` to `objects.json` we even get a json response:

```json
{"Kurskod":"TGTU49","Kursnamn":"Teknikhistoria","Omgång":"1","Kurstillfälle":"TGTU49 1445-1503 Valla"}
```

json looks much better and it's a lot easier to parse, but unfortunately if we instead search for "TGTU" we only get one match but using html we get six. What's worse, there's a lot less information given with json. `data-id` for example seems important as it's the unique id signifying the course.

As I'm writing this I tried `.txt` as well and we get a much larger json response which contains `data-id`, among other things.

Investigating the page source in ta schedule page we find

```html
<span class="hidden" id="links_base" data-base="https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/ri.html?h=t&amp;sid=3&amp;p=0.m%2C20150117.x&amp;objects=363730.219&amp;ox=0&amp;types=0&amp;fe=0"></span>
```

Which seems to suggest that we can send a request directly to <https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/ri.html> with url parameters.

For example

<https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/ri.html?sid=3&p=140703-141231&objects=363972.219>

Is a search for `TGTU49` (data-id: 363972.219) between 2014-07-03 and 2014-12-31 and

<https://se.timeedit.net/web/liu/db1/schema/ri.html?sid=3&p=140703-141231&objects=363972.219%2C363741.219>

searches for `TGTU49` (data-id: 363972.219) and `TATA49` (data-id: 363741.219).

`sid` is an important flag here which specifies what information you're interested in.

```
sid               Information given
------------------------------------------------------
3                 Date Course Local Type Teacher Group
4                 Date Type Teacher Local
others            Date
```

There's a bunch of other parameters which we can simply ignore. This time if we replace `.html` to `.json` we get a nice json request:

```json
{
   "columnheaders":[ "Kurs", "Lokal", "Undervisningstyp", "Lärare", "Studentgrupp", "Fria grupper", "Information till student", "Studentförening", "URL" ],
   "info":{ "reservationlimit":50, "reservationcount":17 },
   "reservations":[
      {
         "id":"361731",
         "startdate":"2014-11-04",
         "starttime":"13:15",
         "enddate":"2014-11-04",
         "endtime":"15:00",
         "columns":[ "TGTU49", "KEY1", "Föreläsning", "Dick Magnusson", "KA3, EMM3, EL3, PRO2", "", "", "", "" ]
      }, ...  ]
}
```

We can also get information formatted as `.txt` and `.csv`. For parsing purposes the best one should be json, as we can use rust's [json deriving][], but then we need to create a bunch of structs. `.csv` is actually very easy to parse and it looks like this:

```
TimeEdit, Linköpings universitet
"TGTU49, Teknikhistoria, 1, TGTU49 1445-1503 Valla", 2014-07-03 - 2014-12-31 ,
Startdatum, Starttid, Slutdatum, Sluttid, Kurs, Lokal, Undervisningstyp, Lärare, Studentgrupp, Fria grupper, Information till student, Studentförening, URL
2014-11-04, 13:15, 2014-11-04, 15:00, TGTU49, KEY1, Föreläsning, Dick Magnusson, "KA3, EMM3, EL3, PRO2", , , ,
...
```

Which is what I did. For a more stable library I should probably switch to json parsing, but there it is.

I made a [rust crate][libtimeedit] which uses the outlined approach to retrieve scheduling information from timeedit. There's a bunch of things I'm not supporting, but it's enough for my needs. I made a simple [cli][liuschema] and integrated a `.schema` command into my [irc bot][].
