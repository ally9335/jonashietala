I like [Hearthstone][] and recently the next expansion [Goblins vs Gnomes][] so I wanted to install and play it. It didn't work in vanilla wine, with a "time out error", but I found a [bug report][] which makes it work. Here's a short summary:

Get wine source from [git][]. My version was `wine-1.7.30-121-g6fe4d9e`.

Make `shlexec.patch` inside the source directory

```{.diff}

```

Before `make` run

```{.bash}
patch -p1 < shlexec.patch
```

Then do `make` and `make install` as normal and have fun with Hearthstone.
