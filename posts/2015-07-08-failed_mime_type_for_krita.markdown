I thought [Krita][] worked fine... Until I tried to save. Krita crashed whenever I tried to save (or open) a file and gave the error:

```
Could not find mime type "application/x-krita"
```

Turns out if you reinstall the package `shared-mime-info` which comes natively with Slackware the problem goes away.
