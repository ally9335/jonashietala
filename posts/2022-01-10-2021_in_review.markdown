A new year is always a good time to review the past year. Funny how this is already [the 12<sup>th</sup> year][previous years] I've done this kind of quick review... Time sure flies.


# 2021 Non-Geek Achievements

0. Started strength training using a strength coach from [Kabuki][].

    I got inspired by the book [Peak][peak] that makes the case for the efficiency of having an experienced coach guide your skill development, and I decided to try out the virtual coaching. I get help with designing a program and checking my form and so far it's been great.

0. Wrote [8 blog posts][blog posts].
0. Started the re-read of [The First Law][abercrombie] series and the other books in the universe.

    The stand-alone books *Best Served Cold* and *The Heroes* are seriously great (haven't gotten to *Read Country* yet).

0. I [self-published a book][whycrypto]!

    ![It's so real I can hold it in my hand.](/images/whycrypto/cover-hand.png)

0. Got funding for [BitPal][], an open-source project I've been working on.
0. Wrote a bunch of Rust.

    Bought a bunch of Rust programming books too, but the only one I've read yet is *Programming Rust*, which was very good.

0. Wrote a lot of Elixir.

    Also read a bunch of Elixir books. *Elixir in Action* was fantastic.

0. Wrote some C, Python, Typescript and probably something else too.
0. Started using a (very) [custom keyboard layout][t-34] on a 34-key split keyboard.

0. Did some web design.

    The book *The Non-Designer's Design Book* is great for design-fledglings like me.

## Boardgames I remember

- *Vital Lacerda* is famous for designing thematic and very complex Eurogames. Some hate them, others maintain that they're the best things since sliced bread, and I lean towards the latter.

    I bought and played three of them:

    0. [On Mars][] is very complex with a lot of rules (it took me ~30 min to explain them, even though I skipped a bunch and came prepared). Still, it's an absolutely amazing game and it was the highlight of the year for me.
    0. [The Gallerist][] is also on the complex side, but I still find it very approachable. Also an amazing game and it's right up there with On Mars for me.
    0. I only played [Vinhos][] once. While it's undoubtedly a very good game, it has taken a step back compared to the two other Lacerdas. I'd like to play it more.

- [Food Chain Magnate][] is easily one of my favorite games of all time, and I got to play a game with the new milestones from the [Ketchup expansion][ketchup]. And what can I say? It was great, and if you want more variation to the game the expansion is fantastic.

- My kid is now 4 years old and at long last he's old enough to play some decent board games. Both me and him liked [Animal Upon Animal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17329/animal-upon-animal) and [Rhino Hero](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91514/rhino-hero), which are fun enough to play with adults as well!

## New mangas/manwhas I remember

- Tired of unoriginal OP MCs? Want a smart MC and clever story?

    Then *SSS-Class Suicide Hunter* or *Omniscent Reader's Viewpoint* might be for you! (I hear the light novels are amazing too.)

- Maybe you still want awesome action, but avoid the common tropes?

    Then check out *Legend of the Northern Blade*.

- Perhaps your thing is regression stories?

    I loved *The Beginning After the End* and *Volcanic Age*.

- Or a satisfying combination of fighting and humor?

    *Murim Login* is half-part hilarity and half-part awesomeness.

# 2021 Failures

0. My book project wasn't completely finished.

    I still need to finish the e-book and make it available for sale.

0. Did not advance [BitPal][] into a useable state.

    This is my open source cryptocurrency payment processor I've been working on. Unfortunately, it's still not in a state where I'd be comfortable for others to use. Apart from the missing documentation, the web interface is still work-in-progress and there are some breaking changes to the API I'd like to make.

# Plans for 2022

0. Be with my kids.

    They're in a lovely age right now.

0. Finish my book project for real.

    This includes making the e-book, some blog posts about the process, integrate with BitPal to sell digital copies and everything else to completely wrap-up the project.

0. Exercise & health focus.

    - I will eat healthier.
    - I will continue working with my strength coach.
    - I will exercise up to 5 days a week (weight lifting + grappling).

(I'm working on converting these to [SMART goals][SMART]. We'll see how that goes, maybe I'll make another post about them, but maybe not.)
