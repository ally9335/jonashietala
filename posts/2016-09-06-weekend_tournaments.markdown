This weekend was filled by playing cards. On Saturday I hosted a small Game of Thrones tournament and on Sunday the local Netrunner community hosted a small summer kit tournament.

Game of Thrones
===============

We've had a similar tournament once before when me and my girlfriend invited two of our friends and had a small 4 person tournament. The last time I was the only one with any cards and I had made 4 decks which we then drafted. Quite surprising to us my girlfriend Veronica the tournament and even admitted it was a fun experience. This time one of our friends Filip and I had practiced a bit and we even went to a regionals before while Veronica hadn't played at all since the last tournament and the other friend barely knew the rules.

The tournament was a success and we had a good time. I managed to eek out a win against Filip but extremely surprisingly Veronica managed to beat us all once again. I'm still in shock and I'm still not sure how it all happened... *Again*. But I'm very proud of her of course! And this time she exclaimed how *fun* it all was, several times during the day! I'm sure it was fun [killing][], [burning][] and [killing us some more][]...

Netrunner
=========

Before this tournament I and after my [latest tournament report][] I actually had two more tournaments; the regionals in Link√∂ping and the ANRPC finals I qualified for. I was going to and actually stated a writeup but I was kind of tired of card gaming in general at that time. I simply had played too much. In the regionals I just barely made the cut and somehow ended up 2nd. For the ANRPC finals I did the classic error of taking two completely new decks and predictably crashed and burned. I did log the [runner][regionals-runner] and [corp][regionals-corp] decks for the regionals but didn't for ANRPC, they were a classic Dumblefork and some sort of rush Argus.

This small 6 person tournament was the perfect thing for me to reinvigorate my interest in netrunner. I had a great time.

With MWL destroying the runner love of my life and with asset spam being rampant I was forced to choose a new runner. CtM punished me hard on jinteki.net so I decided to [pack the hate][runner]. I was very close to choosing a killing corp but I decided to try to [change my corp deck][corp] which went quite well during the regionals.

I did a ton of mistakes when I played and especially my corp wasn't feeling all too great but somehow I managed to win the tournament! We also streamed the games I think 3 out of my 5 games got streamed. They should be uploaded to Youtube in time.
