After months of procrastination it is time for me to enter [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) again!

I am totally unprepared, but I did setup a setup which actually compiles. I never got audio to run but hopefully I can manage something.

* **Repository:** <https://github.com/treeman/LD29>. Going for C++ this time.
* **Graphics library:** [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).
* **Sound effects:** [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)
* **Graphics:** [mtpaint](http://mtpaint.sourceforge.net/)
* **Timelapse hack:** <https://github.com/treeman/Timelapse>

I halted all school work and the whole weekend is booked, except for Taekwon-do on Sunday. Hopefully I'll get something done!
