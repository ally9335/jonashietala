title: "My MCU movie ranking"

I did the [MCU Movie Re-Watch][rewatch] again this year in preparation for Avengers: Endgame. I wasn't a huge MCU fan before doing the same re-watch for Infinity War, but after that I became one.

For fun I tried to rank the movies as I saw them, this is some sort of accounting my rankings and how they changed compared to last year. I did see Endgame yesterday, but I won't be spoiling it here (other than I thought it was very good).

# S-rank

The creame of the crop. The films I never get tired of.

Movie | Rank this year | Rank last year | change
:----- | -------------- | -------------- | ------
Avengers: Endgame                   | 1 | - | -
Guardians of the Galaxy             | 2 | 5 | +3
Avengers: Infinity War              | 3 | 4 | +1
Iron Man                            | 4 | 1 | -3
Captain America: The Winter Soldier | 5 | 3 | -2
{ .movie-table }

Yes I'm ranking Endgame as #1. It might very well be me coming from it fresh and I haven't settled on it yet.

Guardians of the Galaxy jumped up for a very simple reason: It's the movie with the greatest re-watch value. I just love everything about it.

Iron Man and The Winter Solder went down a few pegs, but they're still **very** good movies. They have quite a different feeling than the others.

# A-rank

Also very good movies, but not in the same league as the above.

Movie | Rank this year | Rank last year | change
:----- | -------------- | -------------- | ------
Ant-Man and the Wasp   | 6  | -  | -
Spider-Man: Homecoming | 7  | 10 | +3
Thor: Ragnarok         | 8  | 12 | +4
Doctor Strange         | 9  | 6  | -3
Ant-Man                | 10 | 7  | -3
Black Panther          | 11 | 2  | -9
{ .movie-table }

These are all pretty close to me and could easily be rearranged.

Although the Ant-Man movies don't perform very well on the box office compared to the other MCU movies I absolutely love them. They're just so *fun*.

Both Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man have a very high re-watch value. In contrast Black Panther didn't hold up well compared to when I saw it at the cinema last year. The anticipation hype probably made me appreciate it more than usual.

I do love Doctor Strange, he's probably my favorite hero together with Iron Man. When looking at it now it feels weird it's only ranked 9th.

# Rank B

Good movies which are only missing something a little extra.

Movie | Rank this year | Rank last year | change
:----- | -------------- | -------------- | ------
Captain Marvel                      | 12 | -  | -
Guardians of the Galaxy 2           | 13 | 9  | -4
Captain America: Civil War          | 14 | 14 | 0
The Avengers: Age of Ultron         | 15 | 13 | -2
The Avengers                        | 16 | 11 | -5
Captain America: The First Avenger  | 17 | 8  | -9
{ .movie-table }

GotG 2 is in a bit of a weird spot. It depends heavily on your mood when you're watching it: it can be amazing or it can fall a little flat. It does have some fantastic moments.

I also didn't know how to rank Captain Marvel. Don't get me wrong---it was a good movie. But I didn't get the "oh my god nerdgasm" feeling (well I did get it a little). When I re-watch it it's ranking will probably change.

When I look at the ranking lists of others the duo Civial War and The Avengers are often very highly rated. But I personally don't quite get the hype, they're good but not very good.

The First Avenger has some cool moments but I honestly zoned out a bit at the end. Not a good sign.

# Rank C

Okay movies.

Movie | Rank this year | Rank last year | change
:----- | -------------- | -------------- | ------
Iron Man 3  | 18 | 15 | -3
Iron Man 2  | 19 | 18 | -1
Thor        | 20 | 16 | -4
{ .movie-table }

It's a little strange. I love Iron Man the character but there are problems with his 2nd and 3rd movies. Everything including Iron Man---and of course Justin Hammer---is great but the villains are lackluster and there's just something missing.

Similarly Thor didn't age very well.

# Rank D

Watchable but not something I'd choose unless for a special occasion.

Movie | Rank this year | Rank last year | change
:----- | -------------- | -------------- | ------
The Incredible Hulk     | 21 | 19 | -2
Thor 2: The Dark World  | 22 | 17 | -5
{ .movie-table }

I really don't think they're bad movies. But there's nothing really noteworthy in them either. They're mostly boring.

# Observations

It's natural that movies with high re-watch value tend to rise in the rankings. But it got me thinking---do good movies have high re-watch value? Can you identify good movies by looking at how re-watchable they are?

GotG, Thor: Ragnarok and Spider-Man surprised me this time of how much more I enjoyed to see them again compared to the other films. Maybe that's a good indication of their quality?

Another thing that stands out is how much your mood and the watching experience contributes. For example I was ecstatic after having seen Black Panther, Infinity War and Endgame at the cinema. That will of course have a huge effects on their rankings. In contrast I was kind of tired and zoned out while watching some of the other movies, like The First Avenger.

Lastly I'll note that the MCU really embodies the phrase "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts". While they might not be the best individual movies I've ever seen, the whole experience of 20 interconnected movies really elevates everything a notch or two.

I've never been as hyped for a movie as I was for Infinity War and Endgame. It was almost ridiculous and I never thought they could live up to my expectations. But they exceeded it.

Can't wait for my next re-watch.
