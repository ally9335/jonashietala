A new year and a lingering feeling of not having done enough during the year. A fast review of the year usually makes me feel better.

# 2018 non-geek achievements

* Was on parental leave for about 7 months.

    It was great although I've been crawling up the walls a little the last month.

* Moved to a small village or society far from Link√∂ping. But kept the job.
* Wrote [5 blog posts][blog posts].

# 2018 geek achievements

* Read through the book [Practical Typography][] and restyled this site to try and internalize the concepts.
* Read a lot of manga and light novels.

    I've tried to keep lists of what I read and watch but I just can't do it consistently so I've stopped trying.

# 2017 failures

* I didn't write much at all during the year.
* No time for hobby projects.
* Read very little.

# Plans for 2019

* Gonna start working remote full time, with occasional travel.
* Make an effort to write more. Both shorter posts and longer articles.
* Spend time on side projects and improving skills.
* Try to get consistent grappling training. It's a *small* hurdle there's no submission wrestling or BJJ here.
