In contrast to [previous years][] I haven't kept up with the blog. For good reason I'd say since we got a child in October! It really alters your perspectives and other things suddenly feel a little less important and of course there's less time to do other stuff.

A little late and incomplete perhaps but at least I'll try to have an unbroken streak of reviews.
