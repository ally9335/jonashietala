title: "Calling closures in a Vec"

In rust one might want to have a list of closures, for example as a list of callbacks.

``` {.rust}
let mut fs: Vec<||> = Vec::new();
fs.push(|| { println!("imma firing my lazer"); });

for f in fs.iter() {
    f(); // error: expected function but found `&||`
};
```

Maybe if we borrow f?

``` {.rust}
for &f in fs.iter() { // error: cannot move out of dereference of `&`-pointer```
    f();
};
```

But then if we dereference f?

``` {.rust}
for f in fs.iter() {
    (*f)(); // error: closure invocation in a `&` reference
};
```

That's not very helpful. Thanks to some friendly guys over at `#rust` at `irc.mozilla.org` I found something which works:

``` {.rust}
for f in fs.mut_iter() {
    (*f)(); // ok!
};
```

A note is that the closure types must be `&mut ||` and not `&||`.

In the end I think that the error messages could be more clear. But now we have a running example and all is well in the world!

``` {.rust}
// Print "imma firing my lazer"
fn main() {
    let mut fs: Vec<||> = Vec::new();
    fs.push(|| { println!("imma firing my lazer"); });

    for f in fs.mut_iter() {
        (*f)(); // ok!
    };
}
```
