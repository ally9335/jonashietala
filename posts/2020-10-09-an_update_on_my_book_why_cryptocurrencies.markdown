Five months ago I [gloriously declared that "my book was done"][done]. Since then I've been working hard to finish the book.

Sorry that's a bit of a lie, I've had a nice long vacation where I didn't work on the book and I'm also on part-time parental leave. And believe me there's not a lot of time left over with two kids pulling for your attention.

Although they won't be finished this year, I've made some good progress on the e-book and on formating the physical book and the goal is to have them ready some time next year. The plan is to release the e-book (PDF and epub) as pay-what-you-want for cryptocurrencies on my site while releasing it as normal on Amazon and similar.

I've also done a re-read of the book to make a bunch of fixes, so if you haven't read the book yet now might be a good time. It's [completely free to read online][book].

Because I started the book almost two years ago (yikes!) there are some new events that I've added:

* As a response to COVID-19, [the FED has printed an extreme amount of money in a very short time][print], displaying the problem with unsound money for all to see.
* [Lebanon became to second country to experience hyperinflation in 2020][lebanon] (Venezuela didn't escape theirs).
* [The U.S. court declared that the mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal][snowden].
* The extradition hearing against Assange, where the U.K. will decide if they should deport him to the U.S., [is a complete farce][farce]. For example the U.S. managed to convince the judge that any reference to the torture in Guant√°namo couldn't be mentioned, so key witnesses were blocked from testifying and evidence were censored.

Yet I feel that nothing has really changed. The argument for cryptocurrencies are the same as two years ago, and they're only growing stronger.
