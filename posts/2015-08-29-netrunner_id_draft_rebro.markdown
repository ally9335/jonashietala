I entered an ID draft tournament in [Netrunner][] hosted in Örebro and this is a brief overview of what happened. Disclaimer: My memory is a little bit fuzzy and the events may or may not correspond to what actually happened.


# The draft

The idea was to randomly sort all entrants and in turn each chooses an ID which nobody else can choose. When everyone has chosen an ID the procedure continues in reverse order. This means you can choose either corp or runner early and leave the other until later.

I got the 5th spot and Geist, Nasir, RP and NEH was chosen before me. If the goal was to do well I should probably have chosen a strong corp like Blue Sun, HB or possibly PE but I had just started playing Noise and I was loving every second of it so that was my choice. It was a little bit boring perhaps as it wasn't a new ID I had to come up, but I had no idea of what I actually wanted to play with as corp so I simply delayed that decision. When it was my turn again most actually good corps had gone and I could choose between Titan, Harmony Medtech, Argus and Biotech (and some others...). Recently some popular Titan lists had popped up on netrunnerdb so I took that one.

This is the drafting result:

Frida unfortunately did not attend the actual draft and she had to pick both runner and corp last.

With Wayland and Jinteki being relatively popular I was thinking of adding I've had worse to Noise... But in the end I decided to be ballsy and skip all that. And no plascretes. But I thought with some careful play and Imp/Utopia shard I could manage. Instead I went with the no frills 3 aesop/3 cache low economy approach which I've found is perfectly fine. I slotted 2 Hacktivist meeting as the local playgroup in Linköping insisted on running Cerebral static and manhunt and maybe others would do weird stuff with currents as well?
