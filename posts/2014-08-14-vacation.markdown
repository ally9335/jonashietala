Finally back from a 2 week vacation up at Övertorneå. It's been pretty great to be taken care of and not doing anything. Well, I did get my ass kicked in Terra Mystica and I played a bit of Minecraft, but still. We got some nice food and my in-laws and my parents were nice.

I'm still feeling extremely tired though and I don't know why. The vacation was great but it feels like I need more.  It's quite horrifying when you come home from your vacation feeling tired.  It's a sure sign of stress and overexertion but I'm not entirely sure what to do about it.

I do have a wonderfully supportive girlfriend though, so things aren't looking all too bleak, maybe I can survive.
