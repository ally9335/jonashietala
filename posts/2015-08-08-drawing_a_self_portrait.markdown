Drawing is hard. I'd like to improve though. Here's a self portrait I tried to draw in [Krita][]. I'm really slow so I stopped a bit before it really was finished.

<a href="/images/drawing/me/me_crop.png"><img src="/images/drawing/me/me_crop.png" width=400/></a>

Obviously I'd like it to be a bit better, but I'm still a little happy about the glasses and the eyebrows. The mouth and nose is ugly though.
