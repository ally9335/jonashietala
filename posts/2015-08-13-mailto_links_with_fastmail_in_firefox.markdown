You can change the application to handle `mailto:` links in Firefox in Preferences -> Applications. The problem is that you can't input custom urls and some email providers, like hotmail or fastmail, aren't supported. I managed to fix it with the plugin [MailtoWebmails][]. It annoys me that a plugin is needed, but there it is.
