So I entered [Ludum Dare 22](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) this weekend as a preamble for tomorrow's linear algebra exam. The theme this time around was *Alone* and the game I came up with is about a lonely satellite in space, kinda like Wall-E.

# Instructions

Collect junk and other items for you to buy upgrades, and finally, your friend to finish the game. Be careful not to run out of battery, you need to return home to base for a recharge between runs.

# Controls

Arrow Keys - Move around  
Space/Return - Choose item in docking mode  
F1 - Developer console
