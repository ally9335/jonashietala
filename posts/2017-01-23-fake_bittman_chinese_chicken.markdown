Lesson 6! I went to Cervera and bought a holder to allow me to steam chicken.

I broke the recipe on multiple fronts: chicken wings instead of chicken breasts, mushroom soy instead of tamarin, roman salad instead of baby bok choi (where the heck do you find that...) and I even forgot to season with salt and lemon... But the chicken itself turned out really well. Still got a 7 from both me and Veronica.

Next time I will use actual chicken breasts and I won't forget the salt. As usual I will include something more, more salad perhaps.
