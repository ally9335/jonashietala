I can print, but the printer is missing a very important thing that I alluded to in the previous post: filtering dangerous particles and fumes.

This is mostly covered by the kit, but I was missing some parts from the [print it forward][pif] and the kit didn't include a HEPA filter.
Because the printer is in the office and health is super important fixing this was needed so I could start printing some ABS and continue modding the printer.

# Exhaust cover

![I'm missing the exhaust cover where the filter goes in a stock VORON.](/images/trident/exhaust_cover_hole.jpg)

The standard VORON comes with a filter in the back, but the LDO kit doesn't include the fan for the filter and instead uses an [exhaust cover][] to close the hole.

I didn't receive this part, so the first thing I did was to print that part.
This was just a very temporary measure so I printed it in PLA.

# Nevermore filter

![The Nevermore filter is installed next to the back panel.](/images/trident/nevermore_installed.jpg)

The LDO kit includes the [Nevermore filter][], which removes VOCs.
I was confused on how to install it as at the time the LDO docs only mentioned how to install it on a 2.4, not on a Trident.
When I brought it up they [fixed it ][ldo-nevermore] so no big deal.

But they wanted me to mount it using a plenum mount, which my parts didn't have.
I think I received an older version of the Nevermore from the [print it forward][pif] service so I couldn't use it.

I instead printed out the updated plenum and frame connector myself.
Because the point of the Nevermore is to be able to print ABS safely I did this in PLA as well.
I know it's not ideal, but it will have to do.
Lazy as I am I'll run with this and if it breaks I'll replace it then.

I also added some strips of foam tape to the back of the filter to prevent it from scrambling against the back panel.

![Cutting away parts from the fans was horrible. They broke very easily.](/images/trident/nevermore_fans.jpg)

![I finally got to exercise my (very poor) soldering skills!
It was cute how LDO included a small board so that you don't have to crimp any cables.](/images/trident/nevermore_solder.jpg)

# HEPA exhaust filter

![A new HEPA filter. I wasn't able to color match with the print-it-forward parts...](/images/trident/hepa_filter.jpg)

While I have the Nevermore filter, it doesn't filter Ultra-Fine Particulates.
For that you need a HEPA filter.

There were a few solutions with combined carbon and HEPA filter, but since I already have the Nevermore I wanted a standalone HEPA filter.
I found the [Voron HEPA Exhaust Filter][] that replaces the stock filter that seemed like a good option.

With the Nevermore in place I could print the parts using ABS, and they turned out pretty well.

For silence I used a [Noctua FN-A6x25][] fan.
In hindsight I maybe should've used the [PWM variant][4pin], if only to make the wiring simpler.
Now I have this ugly looking wiring in the top corner (it uses the Noctua low-noise adapter).

I also had to create another cable, which wasn't *too* difficult:

1. Converted the 3-pin cable to a 2-pin JST connector and extended it.

   I simply ignored [the yellow RPM speed signal cable][noctua-pins].

1. Connect to a free fan output on the Octopus.
1. Used the 12V selection jumper for the fan output.

# Klipper setup

With the fans installed you also need to configure Klipper to utilize them.

I setup them both as generic fans, so I can control them from the start and end macros:

```
[fan_generic nevermore_fan]
##  Nevermore fan - FAN3
pin: PD13
max_power: 1.0
kick_start_time: 5.0

[fan_generic filter_fan]
##  HEPA filter fan - FAN4
pin: PD14
max_power: 1.0
kick_start_time: 5.0
```

Then in `PRINT_START` I turn on the fans:

```
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=1
SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=filter_fan SPEED=1
```

After the print has finished I don't want to just turn off the fans immediately, but have them run a bit after the print has finished to clear out any toxic fumes.
I accomplished this with a `delayed_gcode`:

```
[delayed_gcode _VENT_OFF]
gcode:
  SET_DISPLAY_TEXT MSG="Venting done"
  SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=nevermore_fan SPEED=0
  SET_FAN_SPEED FAN=filter_fan SPEED=0
```

That I call in `PRINT_END` with a timeout:

```
# Turn off fans after 30 min
UPDATE_DELAYED_GCODE ID=_VENT_OFF DURATION=1800
```

To prevent the fans from turning off mid-print if I get impatient and start a new print before `_VENT_OFF` has been called I also clear the delayed gcode in `PRINT_START`:

```
# Prevent Nevermore and filter fan from being turned off mid print
UPDATE_DELAYED_GCODE ID=_VENT_OFF DURATION=0
```

And now the filter fans turn on and off automatically.

Some people run the Nevermore on 50--80% during print and then go 100% at the end, but I don't know why you can't run it at 100% all the time so that's what I do.

## Reworked `PRINT_START`/`PRINT_END`

I also rewrote the `PRINT_START` and `PRINT_END` macros to make a little more sense to me.
Here they are in their entirety:

```
