title: Plans for Summer of Code
tags: IDA Summer of Code
---

My [first summer job][] is now over, and after a weekend of rest, it is now time to plan for my second summer job: [IDA Summer of Code][].

I will work a month, or 4 weeks, with contributing to [rust][]! The only issue is, I have no idea where to start. I didn't have a strict plan or a vision of what I want to accomplish when I applied, but now I'm running out of time. I need to have an attack plan.

First thing first is to read through the [tutorial][] and to review rust a bit. After that I should go through the open [issues][] and perhaps find an easy issue I can start working on. The idea is to perhaps start with documentation and work from there.

I will also track the irc channel `#rust@irc.mozilla.org` and use their [mailing list][]. I've been idling in their irc channel a while now and they are very friendly and helpful, so I'm sure I'll be able to get help and pointers from them.

But before all that, I need to clean my desk...
