So I've been idling on irc for years now and I've been using [irssi][] for that, which works fine. I have not had notifications enabled, so I can see from the statusbar whenever someone messages me. As I've never been very active this has been fine, but now I figured it's time to fix that.

Fortunately it was very easy, there's even a perfect match for my setup in the [xmonad documentation][]!

Here's a summary:

# Configure xmonad

In `xmonad.hs`, highlight with existing dzen (my statusbar).  

``` {.haskell}
myDzenPP h = defaultPP { ... }
main = do
    bar <- spawnPipe "dzen2 ..."

    xmonad $ withUrgencyHook NoUrgencyHook $ defaultConfig {
        logHook = dynamicLogWithPP $ myDzenPP bar
        , ...
    }
```

# Configure irssi

I used [beepchan.pl][] to only notify on selected channels.

``` {.bash}
settings = {
  "fe-common/core" = {
    bell_beeps = "yes";
    beep_msg_level = "MSGS NOTICES INVITES DCC DCCMSGS HILIGHT";
    beep_when_away = "no";
    beep_when_window_active = "no";
    ...
  };
  "perl/core/scripts" = {
    beep_channels = "#treecraft";
    ...
  };
};

```

# Configure screen

In `.screenrc`

`vbell off # or remove the existing 'vbell on' line` {.bash}

# Configure rxvt

In `.Xdefaults`

`urxvt.urgentOnBell: true` {.bash}
