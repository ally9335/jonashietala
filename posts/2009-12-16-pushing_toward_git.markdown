The time has come; it's time for me to move my source out in the open for the first time.   
I present to you the source of the upcoming game (which has no name yet):

*Repository deleted, never became anything*  
[Available on Github](http://github.com/treeman/)

It's nothing special really, if you want take a look at the code and help me improve it.
