title: 8-puzzle in rust
category: rust
tags: rust
---

I think [rust][] is one of the most interesting upcoming programming languages out there. So I wrote a solution to the 8-puzzle (see the [15-puzzle][15p]) using A\*. It also has a breadth first search for solutions on a specific distance away from the goal.

The solution is not by any means a great one and there are parts I'm a bit annoyed with, but that's mostly because of my inexperience with rust.

Rust was surprisingly easy to use and I like the strong typing and the pattern matching. One feature I found very useful was to do `println!("{:?}", x);` and be able to print any variable, composite or not.

I'm not friends with the different storage containers and especially the moving of values. Often I called a function with a value, but then I couldn't reuse the value in another, so I ended up using `clone()` a bunch. I'm probably abusing it and there's bound to be a better way to do things.

I got a little stumped on the standard library and spent some time perusing the documentation. It was very light on examples, which I find is the by far most useful thing to have in documentation, and I couldn't even find some of the things. But it all worked out with a bit of determination.

I should mention that I'm using rust master, not a stable release, and I'm well aware of rust being in development at the moment. Still things worked out fine and I quite enjoyed dabbling with rust. I'll write some more in it I think.

This is the code, working on `rustc 0.10-pre (5512fb4 2014-01-19 05:56:35 -0800)`:
