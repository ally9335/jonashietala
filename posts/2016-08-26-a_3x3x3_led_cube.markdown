As a follow up of my [hobby project goals][goals] this autumn I have now completed the smallest goal there. I got started a little with soldering by constructing a small 3x3x3 LED cube.

Although extremely hard to see in this picture it actually worked without a hitch! It's not the prettiest job ever but it was quite meditative to work with actually. Now I'm just waiting for the plate to arrive so I can start working on my keyboard.

Oh and the reward for accomplishing this subgoal was to go to black belt academy, a Taekwon-do training camp last week. I like the idea of having clear goals and rewards to work against.
