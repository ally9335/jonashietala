# A brief timeline

It's always fun to reduce your life into a few bullet points;
here's an incomplete and wholly unsatisfying attempt to include some milestones:

TODO restyle, have years in the middle and family/life things to the left
and work/programming/nerd stuff to the right

# How I started programming

I first got a taste of programming when I was maybe 17 and we had a programming course in school with Visual Basic.
Math had always been my favorite subject, but that quickly changed.

The very first book about programming I read was Bjarne Stroustrup's tomb [The C++ Programming Language][c++_book].
I had severe difficulties understanding anything since I read it before even having used C++, but that I did read it from cover to cover indicates just how hyped I was to have a course in a "real" programming language at school.

And it was all downhill from there.
I was hooked.

Like how most people start, I wanted to create an awesome game and game engine.
Predictably, this went nowhere fast so I pivoted to making some [fast game prototypes][games].

Then I started playing around with lots of random small projects, reading lots of programming books, trying out different languages...

And in this way I morphed into a _professional_ programmer where I got paid to {-play around-} program.

# Formative years

I first got a taste of programming when I was maybe 17 and we had a programming course in school with Visual Basic.
Math had always been my favorite subject, but that quickly changed.

The very first book about programming was Bjarne Stroustrup's tomb [The C++ Programming Language][c++_book].
I didn't understand much about it since I read before having used C++, but I did read it from cover to cover indicates just how hyped I was to have a course in a "real" programming language at school.

And it was all downhill from there.
I was hooked on programming.
Like how most people start, I wanted to create an awesome game and game engine.
This was frustrating as I didn't feel I made any progress, so I started to make some [fast game prototypes][games].

I also played around with lots of small projects and reading lots of programming books.
From C to Rust, Lua to Python and Lisp to Haskell, I've loved them all in one way or another.

The biggest lesson here is that *I just enjoy learning new things* and it's a core pillar of my being.

My path in life was thus clear and so I went to the University to program some more.
I nearly made a mistake of studying Physics, but the military service gave me some time to regret that decision before it was too late.
It was interesting working on a submarine, but ultimately the military wasn't my thing so I instead moved to Linköping to [study Computer Science][uni].

The time at the university was great, even if I mostly stayed at home to skip many of the classes to program.
That's the beauty of the system: if you know the material you don't have to go there (and many don't go even though they should).

I got a [summer job at Configura][configura-summer] and after I graduated I continued working there.

# Modern times

After a few years we [moved away from the city][move-away] and I've been working remotely ever since.

During this time I started a grappling club where we do Submission Wrestling / Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, I [wrote a book][book], got [heavily burnt out][burnout] and we got three wonderful kids.

I have hopes, goals and plans for the future, but I have a tendency to fall into rabbit holes and go all-in on various things quite often, so what may be true today will likely change tomorrow.
