TODO ====

Code
----

* Games
    * Downloadable files (should just add links... but where are the files?)
* Youtube shorthand  
    * Just make a custom filter: <https://github.com/yogsototh/yblog/blob/master/site.hs>
    * <https://xinitrc.de/2013/06/22/3.26-Lightyears-away.html>
* 404 - Some funky thing. A game perhaps?
* Sitemap (How to autogenerate??)
* HTML5  
    * Pandoc: <http://hub.darcs.net/co-dan/website/browse/site.hs#214>
    * Modernizer or similar to show html 5 tags for older browsers?
* .txt version of things
    * Only tags left! Seems fruitless

* Update sitemap

Write
